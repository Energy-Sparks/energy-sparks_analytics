        <p>
          The tariff has changed during the last year for this school.
          Savings are calculated using the latest tariff but other Â£ values
          are calculated using the relevant tariff at the time

          <p>
            The table provides the information in more detail.
            Energy Sparks doesn&apos;t have a full set of meter data
            for some schools, for example rural schools with biomass or oil boilers,
            so this comparison might not be relevant for all schools. The comparison
            excludes the benefit of any solar PV which might be installed - so looks
            at energy consumption only.

        es_data_not_in_sync_html: |-
          <p>
            The gas, electricity and storage heater costs are all using the latest
            data. The total might not be the sum of these 3 in the circumstance
            where one of the meter's data is out of date, and the total then covers the
            most recent year where all data is available to us on all the underlying
            meters, and hence will cover the period of the most out of date of the
            underlying meters.

        es_per_pupil_v_per_floor_area_html: |-
          <p>
              Generally, per pupil benchmarks are appropriate for electricity
              (should be proportional to the appliances e.g. ICT in use),
              but per floor area benchmarks are more appropriate for gas (size of
              building which needs heating). Overall, <u>energy</u> use comparison
              on a per pupil basis is probably more appropriate than on a per
              floor area basis, but this analysis can be useful in some circumstances.

              <li>
                Equipment left on rather than being turned off, including
                photocopiers and ICT equipment
              </li>
              <li>
                ICT servers - can be inefficient, newer ones can often payback their
                capital costs in electricity savings within a few years, see our
                <a href="https://energysparks.uk/case_studies/4/link" target ="_blank">case study</a>

              </li>
              <li>
                Security lighting - this can be reduced by using PIR movement detectors
                - often better for security and by moving to more efficient LED lighting
              </li>
              <li>
                Fridges and freezers, particularly inefficient commercial kitchen appliances, which if
                replaced can provide a very short payback on investment (see
                our <a href="https://energysparks.uk/case_studies/1/link" target ="_blank">case study</a> on this).
              </li>
              <li>
                Hot water heaters and boilers left on outside school hours - installing a timer or getting
                the caretaker to switch these off when closing the school at night or on a Friday can
                make a big difference

            This comparison compares the latest available data for the most recent
            holiday with an adjusted figure for the previous holiday, scaling to the
            same number of days and adjusting for changes in outside temperature.
            The change in &pound; is the saving or increased cost for the most recent holiday to date.
