            The gas, electricity and storage heater costs are all using the latest
            data. The total might not be the sum of these 3 in the circumstance
            where one of the meter's data is out of date, and the total then covers the
            most recent year where all data is available to us on all the underlying
            meters, and hence will cover the period of the most out of date of the
            underlying meters.

            The table provides the information in more detail.
            Energy Sparks doesn&apos;t have a full set of meter data
            for some schools, for example rural schools with biomass or oil boilers,
            so this comparison might not be relevant for all schools. The comparison
            excludes the benefit of any solar PV which might be installed - so looks
            at energy consumption only.

              Generally, per pupil benchmarks are appropriate for electricity
              (should be proportional to the appliances e.g. ICT in use),
              but per floor area benchmarks are more appropriate for gas (size of
              building which needs heating). Overall, <u>energy</u> use comparison
              on a per pupil basis is probably more appropriate than on a per
              floor area basis, but this analysis can be useful in some circumstances.

              This benchmark shows how much each school spent on energy last year.

                This comparison benchmark is an alternative to the more commonly used
                per pupil energy comparison benchmark.

              This benchmark compares the energy consumed per pupil in the last year in kWh.
              Be careful when comparing kWh values between different fuel types,
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_energy" target="_blank">
                technically they aren't directly comparable as they are different types of energy.
