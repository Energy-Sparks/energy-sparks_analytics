        </p>
        <p>
          Schools should be aiming to reduce their electricity consumption by
          about 5% per year because most equipment used by schools is getting
          more efficient, for example a desktop computer might use 150W, a laptop
          20W and a tablet 2W. Switching from using desktops to tablets reduces
          their electricity consumption by a factor of 75. LED lighting can be
          2 to 3 times for efficient than older florescent lighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make a signifcant contribution ot mitigating climate
          change schools should really be aiming to reduce their electricity
          consumption by 10% year on year - something which is easily achievable
          through a mixture of behavioural change and tactical investment in
          more efficient equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          An increase in electricuity consumption, unless there has been a signficant
          increase in pupil numbers is inexcusable if a school is planning on contributing
          to reducing global carbon emissions.

          This benchmark compares a school&apos;s current baseload (electricity

          more efficient over the last few years. Any increase should be tracked
          down as soon as it is discovered. Energy Sparks can be configured

          It then reports potential reduction it has spotted. Its a useful way
          determining how efficient appliances which have been switched off are.
          The school will need to know whether appliances have been turned off

          therefore what their electricity consumption is.
        </p>

          The most common reduction is due to some or all of kitchen fridges and
          freezers being turned off over the summer.

          its worth drilling down to see more detailed baseload information on that school, and

          equipment is before making a purchasing decision. Domestic rather than commercial

          Generally if the weather last week was mild then your might
          expect the heating to be coming on at about 6:30am. In colder
          weather depending on the fabric (insulation, thermal mass) of
          the school you might expect the heating to start earlier at
          perhaps 3:00am. If its coming on earlier the school&apos;s boiler
          control probably warrants further investigation.

              Monitoring temperature in the school in the early morning - typically
              available via the school&apos;s BMS or boiler controller, or via temperature
              logger (typically &pound;20)
            </li>
            <li>
              Has the school&apos;s thermostat been correctly located, if in a hall then
              classrooms might be up to temperature many hours before the hall, so perhaps
              the thermostat could be relocated or the hall&apos;s thermostat&apos;s settings
              could be lowered (16C or less)?
            </li>
            <li>
              Otherwise consider whether the radiator output is high enough to get the
              school up to temperature quickly? Fan convector radiators should take less
              than an hour to get a room up to temperature even in cold weather. Is the flow
              temperature high enough, does the pipework allow adequate distribution of heat,
              do the radiators have adequate output, have their TRVs been set too low for
              the main boiler thermostat?
            </li>
            <li>
                If the boiler&apos;s starting time has been set because school users have
                complained its too cold in the morning, consider experimenting
                with the start time. We generally recommened starting the boiler
                2 hours early on a Monday, to give the school more time to heat up
                from the weekend, this may mitigate most of the complaints?

          correlated with outside temperature the start time of the boiler was.
          The closer to 1.0, the more correlated it was and therefore the
          more likely the optimum start control is working well.

          However these calculations are experimental and might not provide
          good indicators of how well the optimum start is working for all schools.
          Drilling down to look at the data for an individual school should provide
          a better indication.
