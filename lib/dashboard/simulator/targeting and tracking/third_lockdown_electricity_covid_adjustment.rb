# between 4 Jan 2021 and 8 Mar 2021 during the thrid UK lockdown
# some schools saw up to a 30% reduction in electricity usage
# this needs to be adjusted for for setting targets for 2021/2022
#
# 1. try to determine whether there has been a signifcant drop, if not do nothing
# 2. if Jan to March 2020 data available use that
# 3. if not then:
#    a. use data from the Autumn as a substitute
#    b. adjust upwards the fit to the 2020/2021 data ex. the 3rd lockdown
