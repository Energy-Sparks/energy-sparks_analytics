      <p>
        Reducing a school's baseload is often the fastest way of reducing a school's energy costs
        and reducing its carbon footprint. At a well-managed school the baseload should remain the same
        throughout the year. Every 1 kW of baseload reduced will save a school £1,300 per year,
        and reduce its carbon footprint by 1,800 kg.
      </p>

  def self.common_causes_html
    %(
      <h3>Common causes</h3>
      A high baseload is often caused by:
      <ul>
        <li>Old freezers and fridges running constantly</li>
        <li>Inefficient IT servers</li>
        <li>Security lights</li>
        <li>Electric water heaters</li>
        <li>Water chillers</li>
        <li>Air conditioning</li>
        <li>Computers, whiteboards and other electrical equipment left running when the school is closed.</li>
      </ul>
    )
  end

  def self.what_to_do_html
    text = %(
      <h3>What you should do</h3>
      To fully determine the causes of your baseload usage you need to do a survey of what
        appliances are being left on overnight and their power consumption.
      <ul>
        <li>Find out whether any electrical equipment or lights are running all the time.
            Do they need to run all the time?</li>
        <li>You should check to see what lights and appliances are left on at the end of the school day
            and get pupils and staff to switch off lights and appliances when they go home,
            and before the school holidays. Don't forget to look in offices or school kitchens.</li>
        <li>Use appliance monitors to check how much energy your school fridges and freezers are using,
            as these need to run all the time. A modern fridge or freezer uses £35 to £45 of electricity a year,
            but old models can use up to £600 of electricity a year.</li>
        <li>Consider replacing old ICT servers with modern servers or move to saving your school's
            data in the 'cloud'. Removing the need for school ICT servers can also save energy previously
            used for air conditioning in school server rooms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are a number of activities which can help you track down your baseload consumption:
