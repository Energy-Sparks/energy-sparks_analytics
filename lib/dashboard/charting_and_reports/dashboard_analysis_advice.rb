            The scatter chart below shows a thermostatic analysis of the school's heating system.
            The y axis shows the energy consumption in kWh on any given day.
            The x axis the number of degrees days (the inverse of temperature - so how cold it is
            <a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/media/137002/ctg075-degree-days-for-energy-management.pdf" target="_blank">explanation here</a> .
            Each point represents a single day, the colours represent different types of days
            .e.g. a day in the winter when the building is occupied and the heating is on.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the heating has good thermostatic control then the points at the top of
            chart when the heating is on and the school occupied should be close to the trend line.
            This is because the amount of heating required on a single day is linearly proportional to
            the difference between the inside and outside temperature, and any variation from the
            trend line would suggest thermostatic control isn't working too well.
