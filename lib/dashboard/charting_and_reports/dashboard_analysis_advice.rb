        Its a useful graph for determining how well controlled the timing of the boiler is?
        A well timed boiler should only come on at about 6:00am in the morning

        and hour before the school closes.

        Does you school's boiler control in the graph above do this?

          The colouring on the graph also demonstrates whether heating and hot water
          were left on in the holidays.
          Try looking along the graph for the holidays highlighted in red
          - during which holidays was gas being consumed?
          Generally gas heating and hot water should be turned off during holidays.
          It isn't necessary to leave everything on,
          and if someone is working in the school it is more efficient
          just to heat that room with a fan heater or similar than the whole school.
          More than half of schools leave their heating on on Christmas Day
          - did your school do this, and was there anyone at school then?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes the school building manager or caretaker is concerned about the school getting too cold
          and causing frost damage. This is a very rare event, and because most school boilers can be programmed
          to automatically turn on in very cold weather  (called 'frost protection') it is unnecessary
          to leave the boiler on all holiday. If the school boiler doesn't have automatic
          'frost protection' then the thermostat at the school should be turned down as low as possible to 8C
          - this will save 70% of the gas compared with leaving the thermostat at 20C.
        </p>
        <% else %>
          <p>
          The colouring on the graph also highlights electricity usage over holidays in red.
          Holiday usage is normally caused by appliances and computers being left on (called 'baseload').
          The school should aim to reduce this baseload (which also occurs at weekends
          and overnight during school days) as this will have a big impact on a school's energy costs.
          Sometime this can be achieved by switching appliances off on Fridays before weekends and holidays,
          and sometimes by replacing older electrical appliances with more efficient new ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example replacing 2 old ICT servers which run a schools computer network which perhaps
            consume 1,500 watts of electricity, to a single more efficient server consuming 500 watts
            would reduce power consumption by 1,000 watts (1.0 kW) on every day of the year.
            This would save 1kW x 24 hours per day x 365 days per year = 8,760 kWh. Each kWh of electricity
            costs about 12p, so this would save 8,760 x 12p = &pound;1,050 per year. If the new server lasted
            5 years then that would be a &pound;5,250 saving to the school which is far more than the
            likely &pound;750 cost of the new server!

          <p>
            A building with good thermostatic control means the heating system brings the temperature
            of  the building up to the set temperature, and then maintains it at a constant level.
            The heating required and therefore gas consumption varies linearly with how  cold it is outside.
            The heating system can adjust for internal heat gains due to people, electrical equipment and
            sunshine warming the building. It can also adjust for losses due to ventilation. Poor thermostatic
            control is likely to cause poor thermal comfort (uses feel too hot or too cold), and excessive gas
            consumption as the  thermal comfort is often maintained by leaving windows open.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, many schools have poor thermostatic control. This can be due
            to poorly located boiler thermostats. A common location for a thermostat in schools
            is in the school hall or entrance lobby whose heating, internal gains and heat losses
            are not representative of the building as a whole, and particularly classrooms.
            Halls are often poorly insulated with few radiators which means they never get up to temperature,
            causing the boiler controller to run the boiler constantly which causes the better insulated
            classrooms to overheat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Poor thermostatic control can also be due to a lack of thermostatic controls in individual rooms,
            which leads to windows being opened to compensate.
          </p>

          <p>
            The scatter chart below shows a thermostatic analysis of your school's heating system.
            The y axis shows the energy consumption in kWh on any given day.
            The x axis the outside temperature. This is inverse of temperature,
            the higher the degree days the colder the temperature.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the heating has good thermostatic control then the points at the top of
            chart when the heating is on and the school occupied should be close to the trend line (red squares).
            This is because the amount of heating required on a single day is linearly proportional to
            the difference between the inside and outside temperature, and any variation from the
            trend line would suggest thermostatic control isn't working too well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two sets of data are provided on the chart. The points associated with the group at the top of
            the chart are those for winter school day heating. As it gets warmer the daily gas consumption drops.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second set of data at the bottom of the chart is for gas consumption in the summer when the
            heating is not on; typically this is from hot water and kitchen consumption. The slope of this line
            is often an indicaton of how well insulated the hot water system is; of the consumption increases
            as it gets colder it suggests a lack of insulation. An estimate of this loss across the last
            year is <%= kwh_to_pounds_and_kwh(insulation_hotwater_heat_loss_estimate, :gas)  %>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The outside temperature at which the two trendlines cross is generally a good indication
            of the schools 'balance point temperature', this is the outside temperature where there are enough
            internal gains to offset heating losses i.e. below this temperature the heating should be
            turned on to maintain the internal temperature.
            A value below 18C is generally good. A value above this might indicate either the school
            is very poorly insulated, or more likely the internal temperature settings may be too high.

          One measure of how well the thermostatic control at the school is working is
          the mathematical value R<sup>2</sup>
          (<a href="<%= url %>" target="_blank">explanation here</a>)
          which is a measure of how far the points are
          from the trend line. A perfect R<sup>2</sup> of 1.0 would mean all the points were on the line,
          if points appear as a cloud with no apparent pattern (random) then the R<sup>2</sup> would
          be close to 1.0. For heating systems in schools a good value is 0.8.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your school's r2 of <%= r2.round(2) %> is <%= r2_rating_adjective %>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For energy experts, the formula which defines the trend line is very interesting.
          It predicts how the gas consumption varies with outside temperature.
        </p>
        <p>In the example above the formula is:</p>

        <blockquote>predicted_heating_requirement = <%= a.round(0) %> + <%= b.round(1) %> * outside temperature</blockquote>

        <p>Outside temperature is calculated as follows</p>

        <blockquote>temperature = min(<%= base_temperature.round(1) %>, the days average temperature)</blockquote>
        <p>
          So for your school if the average outside temperature is 12C
          the predicted gas consumption for the school would be
          <%= a.round(0) %> + <%= b.round(1) %> * 12.0  = <%= predicted_kwh(12.0).round(0) %> kWh for the day. Where as if the outside
          temperature was colder at 4C the gas consumption would be
          <%= a.round(0) %> + <%= b.round(1) %> * 4.0  = <%= predicted_kwh(4.0).round(0) %> kWh. See if you can read these values
          off the trend line of the graph above (degree days on the x axis and the answer -
          the predicted daily gas consumption on the y-axis).
        </p>
        <p>
            The values for the trend line and the text above will vary slightly as the model used in the text
            is more complicated than the one used by the chart, and if expressed in the chart would make it
            more difficult to read.

          For most schools there should be no gas usage at weekends. The only reason gas
          might be used is for frost protection in very cold weather,
          and averaged across the whole year this should be a very small
          proportion of weekly usage
          </p>
          <p>
          For some schools  there is more gas consumption on a Monday and Tuesday than Wednesday,
          Thursday and Friday, as additional energy is required to heat a school up after the heating
          is left off at weekends.
          This energy is being absorbed into the masonry.
          </p>
          <p>
          'Thermal mass' describes a material's capacity to absorb, store and release heat.
          For example, concrete has a high capacity to store heat and is referred to as a
          'high thermal mass' material. Insulation foam,
          by contrast, has very little heat storage capacity
          and is referred to as having 'low thermal mass'.
          </p>
          <p>
          Can you see this pattern at your school from the graph above?<br>
          It's still much more efficient to turn the heating off over the weekend,
          and use a little more energy on Monday and Tuesday than it is to leave
          the heating on all weekend.
          </p>
          <p>
          If the graph shows  high weekend gas consumption, ask your caretaker or building manager
          to check your heating system controls. You may have:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>incorrect or faulty frost protection</li>
            <li>lack a 7 day timer so it is not possible to  turn the heating off at weekends</li>
            <li>incorrect boiler settings</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          By eliminating weekend gas consumption at your school you could save up to
          <%= kwh_to_pounds_and_kwh(weekend_saving_kwh, :gas) %> per year.
          </p>
        <% else %>
          <p>
          There will be some electricity usage at weekends from appliances and devices
          left on, but the school should aim to minimise these. Schools with low weekend
          electricity consumption aim to switch as many appliances off as possible
          on a Friday afternoon, sometimes providing the caretaker or cleaning
          staff with a checklist as to what they should be turning off.

            Electricity baseload is the electricity needed to provide power to appliances that keep running at all times.
            It can be measured by looking at your school's out of  hours electricity consumption.
            The graph below shows how your school's electricity 'baseload'
            has varied over time:

        Reducing a school's baseload is often the fastest way of reducing a school's energy costs
        and reducing its carbon footprint. For each 1kW reduction in baseload, the school will save
        Â£1,050 per year, and reduce its carbon footprint by 2,400 kg.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look carefully at the graph above, how has the baseload changed over time?
        Does it change seasonally (from summer to winter)? There should be very
        little difference between summer and winter electricity baseload, unless
        there is something not working properly at the school, for example
        electrical heating left on accidentally?

      It is useful in diagnosing what changes have happened over the
      the last year which may have changed electricity consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
      At most schools the overnight consumption between 7:00pm in the
      evening and 6:00am in the morning is relatively constant. Is this
      the case at you school? There are a few reasons why there might
      be a small change during the night e.g. central heating boiler
      pumps sometimes runing on cold nights in the winter (frost protection)
      but any significant change should be investigated as you might be
      able to save electricity and costs through fixing the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
      During the day electricity power consumption rises rapidly and
      often peaks around midday.
      </p>
      <p>
      See if you can spot some of the following typical characteristics in the
      chart:
      </p>
      <ul>
      <li>
        Electricity consumption starting to increase from about 7:00am
        when the school opens, and lights and computers are switched
        on rapidly increasing consumption. What time does your school
        open and who is first to arrive?
      </li>
      <li>
        Its often possible to see when cleaners arrive at the school,
        in some schools its in the morning before school opens,
        at others its in the evening after school closes. Can you
        spot the cleaners on the chart? Its common for cleaners to
        switch all the school lights on; its possible to save electricity
        by asking them to only turn the lights on in the rooms they are cleaning
      </li>
      <li>
        The highest point on the charts is often around lunchtime
        when all the school lights and computers are switched on.
        You can often see a peak between 11:30am and 1:00pm when
        hot plates are switched on for school meals. Can you see
        a jump in consumption of between 2kW and 4kW at this time
        which might be the hot plates?
      </li>
      <li>
          After the school closes there should be a gradual reduction
          in electricity consumption as teachers leave and lights
          and computers are switched off
      </li>
      <li>
          Sometimes there is a regular evening event which increases consumption
      </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
          The graph above shows consumption <%= @period %>. At most schools this
          should be relatively constant <%= @period %>, unless:

          <ul>

          The school is occupied <%= @period %> when consumption might increase
          during the day
          </li>
          <li>
          The school has solar panels which might cause consumption to drop
          during the middle of the day when the sun is out
          </li>
          <li>
          Electrical hot water heaters left on during the holidays causing
          peaks in consumption often in the morning, but sometimes throughout the day.
          </li>
          <li>
          The school has security lights which causes consumption to rise
          overnight when the sun goes down
          </li>
          <li>
          The school has electrical water heaters running through the weekend,
          which will cause peaks in consumption often in the morning, but
          sometimes  throughout the day.

      you think of a reason why these might have occurred? One of the most

        'Frost Protection' is a feature built into most school boiler controllers
        which turns the heating on when it is cold outside in order to prevent
        frost damage to hot and cold water pipework.
        </p>
        <p>
        A well programmed control will turn the boiler on if a number of conditions are met, typically:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The outside temperature is below 4C (the point at which water starts to freeze and expand)</li>
          <li>And, the internal temperature is below 8C</li>
          <li>And, for some controllers if the temperature of the water in the central heating system is below 2C</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Typically, this means the 'frost protection' only turns the heating on if it is cold outside, AND
        the heating has been off for at least 24 hours - as it normally takes this long for a school to
        cool down and the internal temperature of the school to drop below 8C. So, in general in very cold weather
        the heating would probably not come on a Saturday, but on a Sunday when the school has cooled down
        sufficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
        Although 'frost protection' uses energy and therefore it costs money to run, it is cheaper than
        the damage which might be caused from burst pipes. Some schools don't have frost protection
        configured for their boilers, and although this saves money for most of the year, it is common
        for these schools to leave their heating on during winter holidays, which is signifcantly more expensive
        than if frost protection is allowed to provide the protection automatically.
        </p>
        <p>
        The 3 graphs below which are for the coldest weekends of recent years, attempt to demonstrate whether
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
        <li>Frost protection is configured for your school and</li>

      <p>
        The graph shows both the gas consumption (blue bars), and the outside temperature
        (dark blue line) on a cold weekend (Saturday through to Monday).
        If frost protection is working the heating (gas consumption) should come on when
        the temperature drops below 4C - but not immediately on the Saturday as the
        'thermal mass' of the building will mean the internal temperature stays above 8C
        for at least 24 hours after the school closed on a Friday.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the outside temperature rises above 4C, the heating should go off. The amount
        of gas consumption (blue bars) should be about half the consumption of a school
        day (e.g. the Monday), as the heating requirement is roughly proportional
        to the difference between the inside and outside temperatures, and because
        the school is only being heated to 8C rather than the 20C of a school
        day then much less energy will be used.
      </p>

              is forced to leave their heating on at maximum power over cold weeks and holidays</li>

          or is configured to come on and bring the school up to too high a temperature e.g. 20C.</li>

        Sometimes the 'thermostatic' scatter plot on the graph can be misleading, and
        thermostatic control is either better or worse than the R<sup>2</sup> suggests.
        </p>
        <p>
        An alternative way of looking at the thermostatic control is to look at whether
        a school's gas consumption changes on a day when the outside temperature changes
        signifcantly. It is common, particularly in Spring for outside temperatures to increase by
        more than 10C during the day (called a large diurnal temperature range, typically caused
        by a cold ground temperatures after the winter reducing overnight temperatures,
        and warm Spring sunshine during the day).
        In theory if outside temperatures rise by 10C, then the heating loss through a building's
        fabric (walls, windows etc.) will more than halve (as the heat loss is proportional
        to the difference between outside and inside temperatures). If the school has good thermostatic
        control then you would expect so see a similar drop in gas consumption over the course of
        the day.

        <h4>Optimum Start Control? Or, is your boiler turning on too early or being left on too late??</h4>
        <p>
        Most modern commercial boilers used in schools support 'optimum start control' - this is
        where the boiler controller learns over time how long it takes to heat up a school
        depending on how cold it is outside and inside. This allows the boiler to be turned
        on later in the morning (e.g. 06:00am) in milder weather saving energy and earlier (e.g. 04:00am)
        in colder weather. Without this type of control's schools often set their heating
        to come on at a fixed time, often earlier in the day (e.g. 04:00am) just in case
        the weather is cold, but this is unnecessarily early in mild weather and wastes energy.
        </p>
        <p>
        If your boiler has optimum start control which is working well it could save
        up to 20% of your school's heating costs.
        </p>
        <p>
        However, optimum start control often goes wrong and starts the heating far too early in
        the morning wasting even more energy than those schools without it.
        </p>
        <p>
        The chart below compares 2 days, one colder than the other:

      <p>
        Does your school have optimum start control? If it does you would expect the boiler
        to start later on the milder day? Does it start earlier on the colder day?
      </p>
      <p>
      This graph is also useful in determining whether your boiler is starting at a reasonable
      time in the morning. It depends a little on the school, but for these 2 days you might expect
      the boiler to start at 5:30am on the colder day and perhaps 06:30am on the milder day. Is this
      the case for your school?
      </p>
      <p>
      Is the heating also turning off at a reasonable time, perhaps half an hour before school closing time?
      The school could save energy by ensuring the boiler turns off at the right time.

        Hot water is schools is generally provided by a central gas boiler which then circulates
        the hot water around the school, or by more local electrically powered immersion
        or point of use heaters.
        </p>
        <p>
        This section of the dashboard attempts to help analysis gas based hot water heating
        where a gas boiler, generally in the boiler room circulates hot water around the
        school. These systems are often quite inefficient, because they circulate hot water
        permanently in a loop around the school so hot water is immediately available
        when someone turns on a tap rather than having to wait for the hot water to come
        all the way from the boiler room. The circulatory pipework used to do this is often
        poorly insulated, and loses heat. Often these types of systems are only 20% efficient
        compared with direct point of use water heaters which are often over 90% efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
        The graph below attempts to analyse your school's hot water system by looking
        at the heating over the course of the summer, just before and during the start
        of the summer holidays. If the hot water has been accidentally left on during the summer
        holidays, it is possible to see how efficient the hot water system is by
        comparing the difference in consumption between occupied and unoccupied days.
        </p>
        <p>
        The Energy Sparks analysis tries to automate this comparison, but sometimes doesn't get
        this right, as its much easier for a human to do this by looking at the graph.

        Look at the graph, has the hot water been left on either during the summer holidays
        or at the weekend?
      </p>
      <p>
        The Energy Sparks automated analysis suggests the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>An average school day consumption of <%= FormatEnergyUnit.scale_num(avg_school_day_gas_consumption) %> kWh</li>
        <li>An average weekend day consumption of <%= FormatEnergyUnit.scale_num(avg_weekend_day_gas_consumption) %> kWh</li>
        <li>An average holiday day consumption of <%= FormatEnergyUnit.scale_num(avg_holiday_day_gas_consumption) %> kWh</li>
        <li>Likely overall efficiency: <%= percent(efficiency) %></li>
        <li>Estimate of annual cost for hot water heating: <%= kwh_to_pounds_and_kwh(annual_hotwater_kwh_estimate, :gas) %>
        <li>Benchmark annual usage for school of same size <%= FormatEnergyUnit.scale_num(benchmark_hotwater_kwh) %> kWh (assumes 5 litres of hot water per pupil per day)</li>
        <li>If the school matched the annual benchmark consumption it would save the equivalent energy needed to heat  <%= baths_savings %> baths
        of hot water every year, or <%= baths_per_pupil %> per pupil!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Energy Sparks analysis above is based on looking at data patterns and should be seen as a reasonable
        estimate for the efficiency of your hot water system.

        <p>
        The Energy Sparks Electricity Simulator breaks down the electricity use within a school to different appliance types.
        Initially, it does this automatically based on the existing smart meter data, and a knowledge of the consumption
        of appliances at other schools where we have undertaken a physical audit of appliances in the past.
        As such it is an 'educated guess' at how electricity is consumed in a school and can be refined by an audit of a school's
        appliances which could be performed by pupils.
        </p>
        <p>
        The simulator is designed to help make more rational decisions when replacing appliances,
        for example it allows via the configuration editor you to answer the question
        'How much would I save if I installed more energy efficient lighting?',
        or 'How much would I save if I replaced the school's ICT servers with more efficient ones?
        </p>
        <p>
        For each appliance type, using a variety of external data (e.g. temperature, sunshine data and solar PV data)
        and occupancy patterns it assesses realistic usages for every &frac12; hour for each appliance type.
        The results are presented below.

        </p>
        <p>
        ICT (Servers, Desktops, Laptops, Network hardware) is used throughout most schools and
        is often the largest or the second largest consumer of electricity after lighting.
        Over the last 20 year's school's electricity consumption has increased significantly
        and most of this increase is from greater use of ICT. In the last 2 or 3 years
        at most schools this consumption has started do drop as older less efficient ICT
        equipment is replaced with more modern faster more efficient ICT.
        </p>
        <p>
        There are two main ways you can reduce ICT electricity consumption,
        you can ensure desktops and laptops are turned off when not in use by
        setting a standby policy e.g. go to standby after 15 minutes of inactivity,
        and for servers, to replace the servers with more modern more efficient
        ones or by moving your servers to the cloud, both of which can
        pay your capital investment (purchase costs) in as little as a year as
        a result of reduced electricity costs.
        <p>
        The first chart groups the ICT usage by week across the whole year.
        Do you think this is the correct pattern for your school? Are the
        desktops and laptops switched off during holidays and at weekends?

        Does this look about right for your school? Is ICT used throughout

        <h2>Heating Using Electricity:</h2>
      <% end %>
      <p>
      Energy Sparks electricity simulator attempts to calculate how much
      electricity is used for heating in a school. However, it is quite
      difficult for the simulator to estimate this accurately and
      requires as physical audit of the school to provide accurate values.
      This will involve someone from the school auditing what electrical
      equipment is used for heating in a school in the winter - these
      would typically be electric fan heaters, but sometimes also
      air source heat pumps.

      <%= @body_start %>
      <p>
      Electrical heating using fan heaters can be very expensive compared with
      gas - perhaps 5 times more expensive. However, this depends if the fan
      heater is just being used to heat a localised area or a whole room.
      Generally, we would advise against using fan heaters in schools if possible
      as each heater might be cost &#163; 2 per day per heater, or cost &#163; 150
      across the course of a winter - probably 10 times more than the fan heater
      cost to buy. The only time we recommend fan heaters is for use in holidays
      if there are very few people in a school and it saves turning on the heating
      for a whole school.

        <% end %>
        <p>
        Security Lighting (the lights around the perimeter of a school) which
        come on at night can be quite expensive to maintain. Their energy consumption
        depends on how they are controlled (switched on and off) and the efficiency
        of the lighting itself.
        </p>
        <p>
        For the maximum energy efficiency Energy Sparks generally recommends PIR
        based security lighting, which only comes on when movement is detected as
        it can reduce consumption by more than 90% - it can also be more secure
        as intruders are often more likely to be deterred if lighting suddenly switches
        on, rather than is on all the time, as neighbours and passers-by are more
        likely to notice.
        </p>
        <p>
        In addition, switching to LED lighting often has very short paybacks because
        security lighting on a timer is on for about half the hours in a year.

        Energy Sparks is not very good at automatically determining the kitchen

        </p>
        <p>
        Where cooking takes place on site it is important that the kitchen doesn't turn
        hobs and ovens on too early. They often turn everything on as soon as they arrive
        at the school every day at 8:00am, but don't use the appliances until much later
        perhaps 11:00am, so wasting electricity between 8:00am and 11:00am.
        </p>
        <p>
        To improve this, it is worth speaking to the kitchen staff about their procedures
        - do they know for example how long ovens take to heat up (typically 10 to 15 minutes).

          This chart is identical to the previous chart but replaces temperature
          with degree days. Degree days &hyphen; how cold it is, increases as it gets colder
          and makes it easier to see gas consumption increasing with coldness
          (an explanation of degree days appears above under &apos;By Week: Gas&apos;).

          You should be able to see the gas consumption increasing and decreasing
          with degree days. Any change from this tracking (correlation) might be
          the impact of recent changes being made to boiler control, or because you
          have poor thermostatic control in your school. This means your heating controls
          are not adjusting the boiler in response to changes in temperature.

          This chart automatically adjusts the schoolâs gas consumption for outside temperature,
          removing the effect of changes in outside temperature. This should make it easier to
          see the impact of changes you might be making in boiler control:

        <p>
          The quality of the adjustment for outside temperatures may not be perfect as it
          is dependent on the quality of the school&apos;s thermostatic control (see the thermostatic
          chart on the Advanced Boiler Control page for an explanation). But, it should give you
          a much better idea if you are making progress with reducing gas consumption, and the
          long&hyphen;term impact of any changes you might have made? For example, a reduction on the
          chart from one week to the next of 10&percnt; might indicate a long&hyphen;term annual reduction of
          10% in your heating costs.

          This chart allows you to see when your boiler has been turning on and off

          By clicking the legend at the bottom of the chart, you can turn the lines
          on the chart on and off for individual days &hyphen; making it easier to understand
          what is going on at the school.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a school with a heating system that is working well (good boiler, good pipework
          for heat distribution, large enough radiators, and reasonable insulation),
          you might expect the heating to turn on at about 6am, and peak for the next
          2 hours while the school is being heated up, and then gradually reduce during the day.
          In most schools the heat generated by electrical equipment and 30 pupils in a class room
          would suggest classrooms need very little additional heating from the school&apos;s boiler,
          once the pupils arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the boiler has &apos;optimal start control&apos; configured, you might notice the start time of
          the boiler changing automatically &hyphen; from perhaps 6:30am in milder weather to earlier
          e.g. 4:30pm in colder weather. In very cold weather you might notice the heating coming on &apos;at random&apos;
          â this is most likely frost protection &hyphen; the boiler turning the heating system on to stop
          the school&apos;s pipework freezing.
