# Alerts: Energy Sparks alerts
#         this is a mix of short-term alerts e.g. your energy consumption has gone up since last week
#         and longer term alerts - energy assessments e.g. your energy consumption at weekends it high
#
# the current code strcucture consists of an alert base class from which individual classes analysing
# different aspect of energy consumption are derived
#
# plus a reporting class for alerts which can return a mixture of text, html, charts etc., although
# much of the potential complexity of this framework will not be implemented in the first iteration
#
