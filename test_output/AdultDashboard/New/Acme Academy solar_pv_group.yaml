  :content: "\n      <p>\n        Installing solar pv at your school will reduce the
    electricity you consume from the national grid,\n        and reduce your school&apos;s
    carbon emissions. It should be seen as an addition to reducing\n        your school&apos;s
    electricity consumption through energy efficiency rather than an alternative.\n
    \       Economically, following the removal of subsidies from solar panels it
    might take\n        between 10 and 15 years to payback the capital costs of installing
    solar panels, but\n        PTAs will often be prepared to raise some of the capital
    costs making it more economic for schools.\n      <p>\n    "

    using half hourly electricity\n        meter data from your school and real solar
    pv data for your locality for the last year\n        to produce a reasonable estimate
    of the potential for solar pv to reduce your\n        main consumption. Energy
    Sparks has estimated that installing\n        250 kWp provides the\n        best

    currently assume you will get some income from any\n          exported electricity.
    Since the end of the Feed-In-Tariff in April 2019 there has\n          been no
    replacement scheme to provide income from exported electricity. The\n          government
    have proposed a Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme, but\n          it is not
    in place yet (as of Nov 2019) but some suppliers are\n          already offering
    to pay you for any exported electricity.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The
    calculations are based on a current electricity price of 15p/kWh,\n          if
    mains electricity prices reduce there will be a lower economic benefit and\n          longer
    payback to the installation.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          If the school
    becomes more efficient at using electricity and reduces its electricity\n          consumption
    the benefit will also reduce.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The capital
    costs in the table above are estimates based on\n          current market rates;
    an installation cost at your\n          school might be a little different.\n
    \       </li>\n        <li>\n          The estimates assume your have roof space
    and that is it roughly\n          south facing - as this is optimal for schools
    whose peak demand is\n          during the middle of the day when south facing
    panels produce the most electricity.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The
    benefits of your solar pv will be reduced if you make your school more energy
    efficient.\n          However, if you want your school to reduce its carbon emissions
    you should consider \n          both installing solar panels and reducing your
    electricity consumption.\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    "
