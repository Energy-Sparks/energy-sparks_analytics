    <p>
     Hot water in schools is generally provided by a central gas boiler which
     then continuously circulates the hot water in a loop around the school.
     Sometimes these gas-based systems are supplemented by more local
     electrically powered immersion or point of use heaters.
     </p>
     <p>
     The circulatory gas-based systems in schools are generally very
     inefficient, averaging about 15&percnt; &semi; for your school we estimate
     39%.
     These inefficiencies offer significant cost and carbon emission saving
     opportunities if addressed.
     </p>
     <p>
     These systems are inefficient because they circulate hot water permanently
     in a loop around the school so hot water is immediately available when
     someone turns on a tap rather than having to wait for the hot water to come
     all the way from the boiler room. The circulatory pipework used to do this
     is often poorly insulated and loses heat. Often these types of systems are
     only 15% efficient compared with direct point of use water heaters which
     are often over 90% efficient. Replacing the pipework insulation is generally
     not a cost-efficient investment.
     </p>
     <p>
     This section of the dashboard analyses the efficiency of your
     school&apos;s hot water usage and the potential savings from either improving
     the timing control of your existing hot water system or replacing it
     completely with point of use electric hot water systems.

     <h2>Estimate of the efficiency of your hot water system using smart meter data</h2>
     <p>
     The graph below attempts to analyse your school&apos;s hot water system by
     looking at the heating over the course of the summer, just before and
     during the start of the summer holidays. If the hot water has been
     accidentally left on during the summer holidays, it is possible to see how
     efficient the hot water system is by comparing the difference in
     consumption between occupied and unoccupied days:
