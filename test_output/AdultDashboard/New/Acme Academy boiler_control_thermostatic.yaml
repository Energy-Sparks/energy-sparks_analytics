  :content: "\n      <h2>Why thermostatic control is important</h2>\n\n      <p>\n
    \       A building with good thermostatic control means\n        the heating system
    brings the temperature of the\n        building up to the set temperature, and
    then maintains\n        it at a constant level. The heating required and\n        therefore
    gas consumption should vary linearly with\n        how cold it is outside i.e.
    the colder it is outside\n        the higher the gas consumption for heating.\n
    \     </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The heating system can then adjust for internal
    heat\n        gains due to people, electrical equipment and sunshine\n        warming
    the building. It can also adjust for losses due\n        to ventilation. Poor
    thermostatic control is likely to\n        cause poor thermal comfort (occupants
    feel too hot or too cold),\n        and the thermal comfort is then often maintained
    by leaving\n        windows open leading to excessive gas consumption and carbon
    emissions.\n      </p>\n    "

  :content: "\n      <h2>Reasons for poor thermostatic control</h2>\n\n      <p>\n
    \       Unfortunately, many schools have poor thermostatic control.\n        This
    can be due to poorly located boiler thermostats.\n        A common location for
    a thermostat in schools is\n        in the school hall or entrance lobby whose
    heating,\n        internal gains and heat losses are not representative\n        of
    the building as a whole, and particularly classrooms.\n        Halls are often
    poorly insulated with few radiators\n        which means they never get up to
    temperature, causing\n        the boiler controller to run the boiler constantly
    which\n        causes the better insulated classrooms to overheat,\n        and
    more gas consumption than necessary.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Poor thermostatic
    control can also be due to a lack\n        of thermostatic controls in individual
    rooms,\n        which leads to windows being opened to compensate.\n        If
    it’s difficult to provide local thermostatic control\n        in each room, for
    example Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs)\n        can’t be installed on radiators
    you could ask your boiler\n        engineers whether\n        <strong>’weather
    compensation’<!╌ technical term don't translate ╌></strong>,\n        which reduces
    the temperature of the circulating central\n        heating water in milder weather
    can be configured for your boiler as an alternative.\n      </p>\n    "

    then\n        the points at the top of chart when the heating\n        is on should
    be close to\n        the trend line. This is because the amount of heating\n        required
    on a single day is linearly proportional to the\n        difference between the
    inside and outside temperature,\n        and any variation from the trend line

    indicates no relationship between how cold\n        it is outside and how much

    consumption. The slope of this line is often\n          an indication of how well
    insulated the hot water system is;\n          if the consumption increases as
    it gets colder it\n            suggests a lack of insulation.\n            An

  :content: "\n      <h2>Using days with large diurnal range to understand thermostatic
    control</h2>\n\n      <p>\n        An alternative way of looking at the thermostatic
    control is to\n        look at whether a school&apos;s gas consumption changes
    on a day when\n        the outside temperature changes significantly. It is common,\n
    \       particularly in Spring for outside temperatures to increase by\n        more
    than 10C during the day (called a large diurnal temperature range,\n        typically
    caused by cold ground temperatures after the winter reducing\n        overnight
    temperatures, and warm Spring sunshine during the day).\n      </ p> \n\n      <p>\n
    \       In theory if outside temperatures rise by 10C, then the heating loss\n
    \       through a building&apos;s fabric (walls, windows etc.) will more than\n
    \       halve (as the heat loss is proportional to the difference between outside\n
    \       and inside temperatures). If the school has good thermostatic control\n
    \       then you would expect so see a similar drop in gas consumption over the
    course of the day.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The chart below shows recent
