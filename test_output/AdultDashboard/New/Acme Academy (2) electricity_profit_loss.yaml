    \   </p>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          this assumes a simple cost model,
    with electricity costing 15p/kWh\n          and gas 3p/kWh\n        </li>\n        <li>\n
    \         generally, this method is used when information is presented to\n          pupils
    because it is easy to understand, and allows them to do simple maths\n          converting
    between kWh and &#163;\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          we also use it
    for economic forecasting, when doing cost benefit\n          analysis for suggested
    improvements to your energy management, as it better\n          represents future
    energy prices/tariffs than your current potentially\n          volatile tariffs
    as these can change from year to year\n        </li>\n      </ul>\n    <p>\n      2.
    <strong>Accounting Costs</strong>:\n    </p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            These
    represent your real energy costs and represent all the\n            different
    types of standing charges applied to your account\n          </li>\n          <li>\n
    \           To do this we need to know what these tariffs are, sometimes these\n
    \           can be provided by all schools by a local authority, and sometimes
    you will\n            need to provide us the information is not available from
