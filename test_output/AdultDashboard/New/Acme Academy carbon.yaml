  :content: "\n      <h2>\n        Carbon Emission Factors\n      </h2>\n      <p>\n
    \       To calculate the school's carbon emissions from the consumption of gas
    and\n        electricity we need to know how much carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
    is\n        produced for every kWh of gas and electricity used by the school,
    these\n        values are called 'emission factors', and they are different for
    gas and\n        electricity.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Gas emissions</strong>\n
    \     </p>\n      <p>\n        For gas the emissions are always the same; for
    every kWh of gas which is\n        burnt in the school boilers 210g of CO<sub>2</sub>
    is emitted. CO\t<sub>2</sub>\n        is emitted as a result of burning gas (CH<sub>4</sub>)
    with\n        oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), to produce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)
    and\n        water (H<sub>2</sub>0) (CH<sub>4</sub>\n        + 4O<sub>2</sub>
    = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O).\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So, if the
    school burns 1000 kWh of gas, it emits 1000 kWh * 210g /kWh =\n        210,000g
    or 210kg of CO<sub>2</sub>.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Electricity
    emissions</strong>\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Electricity is more complicated
    as it varies continuously depending on what\n        power sources are being used
    to supply the National Electricity Grid, these\n        include power stations
    which burn coal and gas which have high emissions,\n        and nuclear power
    stations, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines\n        which emit
    almost zero carbon when producing electricity. On a windy and\n        sunny day
    when a larger proportion of the UK's electricity supply is from\n        solar
    PV panels and wind turbines electricity emissions can be\n        quite low at
    about 100g of CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh of electricity. On\n        calm, cloudy
    days when most of the electricity is coming from gas and coal\n        power stations
    as much as 400g of CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted for every 1 kWh\n        of electricity
    production.\n        <a href=\"https://carbonintensity.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">This
    link</a> shows\n        a graph of the electricity grid's carbon emissions today
    and has a brief video\n        explaining the variability.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n
    \       The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the UK National Electricity Grid\n
    \       has significantly decreased over the last few year's as large number of\n
    \       solar PV panels and many offshore\n        wind turbines have been installed
    replacing coal power stations which have\n        been closed. Average annual
    emissions factors have decreased from 500g\n        CO\t<sub>2</sub> per kWh in
    2012 to about 230g per kWh in 2019.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The table
    below shows where the UK National Electricity Grid has been\n        sourcing
    its electricity from in the last 5 minutes:\n      </p>\n      "

      \     Schools are a source of greenhouse gas emissions, including:\n    </p>\n
      \   <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Transport</strong>\n        : Most cars
      and buses used by pupils and staff to get to school use\n        fossil fuels
      (petrol and diesel) and emit carbon dioxide and other\n        pollutants from
      their exhausts\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Food</strong>\n        :
      The production and transport of food eaten at lunchtime generates\n        greenhouse
      gas emissions. A diet high in meat can generate a lot of\n        greenhouse
      gases, as cows emit a lot of CO<sub>2</sub> and methane\n        as a result
      of eating grass.\n        A vegetarian diet has half the carbon emissions of
      meat-based diet.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Electricity</strong>\n
      \       : The electricity used to power computers, lights and other appliances\n
      \       at the school is often generated in power stations\n        which burn
      gas and coal (fossil fuels)\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Gas</strong>\n
      \       : The gas used to heat the school in the winter, to heat hot water and\n
      \       in cookers in the school kitchens, creates CO2 when it is burnt\n      </li>\n
      \   </ul>\n   \n    <p>\n      Energy Sparks can be used to analyse the carbon
      dioxide emissions from your\n      school's electricity and gas consumption.\n
      \   </p>\n    <p>\n      Energy Sparks converts the energy used in kWh to CO<sub>2</sub>
      using 'carbon emission factors'.\n    </p>\n   \n    <h2>\n      Carbon Emission
      Factors\n    </h2>\n    <p>\n      To calculate the school's carbon emissions
      from the consumption of gas and\n      electricity we need to know how much
      carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is\n      produced for every kWh of gas and
      electricity used by the school, these\n      values are called 'emission factors',
      and they are different for gas and\n      electricity.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n
      \     <strong>Gas emissions</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For gas the emissions
      are always the same; for every kWh of gas which is\n      burnt in the school
      boilers 210g of CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted. CO\t<sub>2</sub>\n      is emitted
      as a result of burning gas (CH<sub>4</sub>) with\n      oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>),
      to produce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and\n      water (H<sub>2</sub>0)
      (CH<sub>4</sub>\n      + 4O<sub>2</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O).\n
      \   </p>\n    <p>\n      So, if the school burns 1000 kWh of gas, it emits 1000
      kWh * 210g /kWh =\n      210,000g or 210kg of CO<sub>2</sub>.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n
      \     <strong>Electricity emissions</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Electricity
      is more complicated as it varies continuously depending on what\n      power
      sources are being used to supply the National Electricity Grid, these\n      include
      power stations which burn coal and gas which have high emissions,\n      and
      nuclear power stations, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines\n      which
      emit almost zero carbon when producing electricity. On a windy and\n      sunny
      day when a larger proportion of the UK's electricity supply is from\n      solar
      PV panels and wind turbines electricity emissions can be\n      quite low at
      about 100g of CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh of electricity. On\n      calm, cloudy
      days when most of the electricity is coming from gas and coal\n      power stations
      as much as 400g of CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted for every 1 kWh\n      of electricity
      production.\n      <a href=\"https://carbonintensity.org.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">This
      link</a> shows\n      a graph of the electricity grid's carbon emissions today
      and has a brief video\n      explaining the variability.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n
      \     The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the UK National Electricity Grid\n
      \     has significantly decreased over the last few year's as large number of\n
      \     solar PV panels and many offshore\n      wind turbines have been installed
      replacing coal power stations which have\n      been closed. Average annual
      emissions factors have decreased from 500g\n      CO\t<sub>2</sub> per kWh in
      2012 to about 230g per kWh in 2019.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The table below

      shows how much of the\n        UK's electricity is being generated from that
      source.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The second column is the amount of carbon
      emitted from generating 1 kWh of\n        electricity from that source. Some
      of the renewable and 'low carbon'\n        sources like solar, wind, hydro and
      nuclear still have a small carbon\n        intensity because of the energy used
      in their manufacture e.g. wind\n        turbines are made of steel, which takes
      energy to manufacture.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The third column is the
      carbon contribution to the total cabron intensity\n        from each source
      in kg CO2 per\n        kWh of electricity produced.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n
      \       And, the final column is the UK's percentage of the\n        total carbon
      emissions from each source.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The carbon intensity
      of the National Electricity Grid is currently\n        0.22 kg CO2/kWh.\n        This
      is calculated by adding up all the carbon contributions in the 'Carbon\n        Contribution'
      columns in the table above.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        The 'biomass' source
      comes from burning waste wood. 'Imports' are from\n        electricity we get
      from other countries like Ireland, France, Netherlands\n        and Norway through
      electricity cables running under the sea.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <strong>Question</strong>\n

      \       : On average over the last year the net carbon intensity of the National\n
      \       Electricity Grid was 0.24 kg CO2/kWh - how does this compare with the\n

      it to\n        be below the figure on a sunny or windy day, but above on dull

    emissions of the grid have\n        varied in intensity as a result of the ever-changing
    mix of electricity\n        sources on the grid. Generally, the intensity of the
    National Electricity\n        Grid is higher in winter, when demand is highest
    and there are not enough\n        renewable (wind, solar) and low carbon (nuclear)
    sources to satisfy demand,\n        and when electricity from gas power stations
    which emit carbon must be\n        turned on to meet this extra demand.\n      </p>\n

      CO<sub>2</sub>\n      emissions from the consumption of gas in school is greater
      during the\n      winter than the summer.\n    </p>\n    "
    :advice_footer: "  \n    <p>\n      <strong>Question</strong>\n      : As gas
      is a fossil fuel and the 'carbon factor' or emissions from\n      burning 1
      kWh of gas can't be reduced, how can the school reduce its gas\n      emissions?\n
      \   </p>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Answer</strong>\n      : The only way for a
      school to reduce carbon emissions from its gas\n      consumption is to use
      less gas: making sure the heating and hot water are\n      not left on during
      holidays, weekends or school hours, and turning the\n      thermostat down.
      An alternative might be to replace the gas boiler with and\n      'air source
      heat pump' which uses electricity but emits much less carbon,\n      but this
      can be expensive to install.\n    </p>\n   \n    <p>\n      Electricity and
      gas are not the\n      only carbon emissions from a school; transport and consumption
      of food also\n      contribute. This should help you calculate the\n      additional
      greenhouse gas emissions from transport and food to get an\n      overview of
      your school's total carbon emissions and perhaps where there\n      may be opportunities
      to reduce your emissions.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      For most schools about 30%
      of carbon emissions come from gas and\n      electricity consumption, 30% from
      food and 30% from transport.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To calculate your school's
      total carbon emissions, you will need to do some\n      research:\n    </p>\n
      \   <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Transport</strong>\n        : You will
      need to find out how staff and pupils get to school, either\n        my doing
      a survey, or by asking school management if a survey has been\n        done
      in the past\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Food</strong>\n        :
      You will need to count how many meals are eaten at school each day\n        (normally
      one of each pupil and staff member), and how many of these\n        are meat
      based, and how many vegetarians?\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Gas
      and electricity</strong>\n        : You just need to find the information on
      Energy Sparks\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>\n      Once you have gathered
      the information you will then need to enter the data\n      into this spreadsheet:\n
      \   </p>\n   \n    <iframe width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"
      src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=D22255E34EA12530%21278999&authkey=%21AA4vdwZUz8mhacQ&em=2&wdAllowInteractivity=False&AllowTyping=True&ActiveCell='Totals'!A1&wdHideGridlines=True&wdHideHeaders=True&wdDownloadButton=True&wdInConfigurator=True\"></iframe>\n
      \    \n    <p>\n      It might be best if you download a copy of the spreadsheet
      (button bottom\n      right), so you can save the information for future use.
      You need to fill in\n      the information in the cells coloured orange which
      have been pre-populated\n      for an example school with 400 pupils.\n    </p>\n
      \   <p>\n      The next section tells you how to gather the data required for
      each of the\n      types of carbon emissions (gas, electricity, transport, food).\n
      \   </p>\n   \n    <h3>\n      1. Transport\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      To calculate
      the 'transport' carbon emissions of a school you need to find\n      out how
      people, both staff and pupils travel to school, and how far they\n      travel.
      For this you might need to do a survey, or school management might\n      already
      know if a 'Transport Survey' has already been carried out at a\n      school.\n
      \   </p>\n    <p>\n      You need to determine how everyone gets to school.
      The most important\n      information to find is how many people travel to school
      by car and how far\n      they travel, as cars generally generate the most carbon
      emissions,\n      accounting for more than 90% of transport carbon emissions
      at most schools.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      You need to find the following information
      for the spreadsheet (Transport\n      Tab):\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      <img src=\"https://lhjawq.sn.files.1drv.com/y4m4xygPzQJ7Qaa2kBkzr9pFBPk0liVNrxne0pLmHDWh1BB2AsBQqViHRLNq_g4D6DJE1sPd8baRNkU6QtwNF3EzLGmZ-8MsceWWQ-kMwCmQJ-bRRrizK-3kdFrZaDRrEEDldeDmW6iXLQSND8b7MA4ZcfXbNTdFHEPrVlGhnGAHce8l9Gy6yAcQGqFOIjJGu32Q4EiDSWJzStc9OatPNjYXg?width=539&height=539&cropmode=none\"
      width=\"539\" height=\"539\" />\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      The easiest way is
      to survey the staff, create a form containing 3 columns,\n      the first with
      the name of the staff member, and the how they get to work,\n      and the third
      with the average distance they travel, and then ask them to\n      provide you
      with the information e.g.\n    </p>\n\n    <table class=\"table table-striped
      table-sm\">\n    <thead>\n    <tr class=\"thead-dark\">\n        <th scope=\"col\">
      Staff member </th>\n        <th scope=\"col\"> Transport Mode </th>\n        <th
      scope=\"col\"> Average daily return distance </th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n
      \     <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n            <p>\n

      valign=\"top\">\n            <p>\n              Petrol car\n            </p>\n
      \         </td>\n          <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n            <p>\n

      \         <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n            <p>\n              Mr
      Jones\n            </p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n
      \           <p>\n              Bus\n            </p>\n          </td>\n          <td
      width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n            <p>\n              6\n            </p>\n
      \         </td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n
      \           <p>\n              Ms Khan\n            </p>\n          </td>\n
      \         <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n            <p>\n              Petrol
      Car\n            </p>\n          </td>\n          <td width=\"200\" valign=\"top\">\n
      \           <p>\n              10\n            </p>\n          </td>\n        </tr>\n
      \     </tbody>\n    </table>\n    <p>\n      You then need to calculate the
      number of staff travelling by each mode and\n      the average distance for
      each Transport Mode - you might need to get a\n      member of staff to help
      you with this. For the example above, you would\n      need to enter under Staff
      - Petrol car: 2 staff (number) and an average\n      distance of 11 miles (average
      of 10 and 12 miles), and under Staff - Bus: 1\n      staff member and an average
      of 6 miles.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      To survey the figures for pupils you might
      need to survey pupils as they\n      arrive at school but asking them to fill
      in a form for you, or you could\n      print out and send a survey home.\n    </p>\n
      \  \n    <h3>\n      2. Food\n    </h3>\n    <p>\n      Food is much easier
      to calculate. You just need to find out how many people\n      eat meat-based
      meals at school each day and how many are vegetarian and\n      enter them into
      the spreadsheet. Most people at the school will eat lunch\n      every day,
      some will be supplied by the school kitchen (you could ask the\n      kitchen
      staff how many meat based and vegetarian meals they serve each\n      day),
      and also packed lunches.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Once you have gathered this
      information you simply enter the 2 numbers into\n      the 'Food' tab of the
      spreadsheet.\n    </p>\n   \n    <h2>\n      3. Electricity and gas\n    </h2>\n
      \   <p>\n      Energy Sparks can calculate this for you automatically if there
      is at least\n      a year of electricity and gas meter readings.\n    </p>\n
      \   <p>\n      Energy Sparks has calculated the following values for your school:\n
      \   </p>\n    \n      <p>\n        &#183; Electricity: 88,000 kg CO2 /year\n
      \     </p>\n    \n    \n      <p>\n        &#183; Gas: 120,000 kg CO2 /year\n
      \     </p>\n    \n    <p>\n      You just need to enter these values in the
