 Acme Academy is a secondary school near Acme AB1 2CD
 with 961 pupils
 and a floor area of 5932m<sup>2</sup>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Your school spent &pound;71,000 (470,000kWh) on electricity
 and &pound;17,000 (580,000kWh) on gas last year.
 The electricity usage is more than well managed schools which spent &pound;47,000. 
 The gas usage is more than well managed schools which spent &pound;15,000: 
 </p> <p>
 Your gas usage is 114% of well managed schools which
 is above average, the school should aim to reduce this,
 which would save you &pound;3,300 (110,000kWh) per year if you matched the most energy efficient (exemplar) schools.
 Your electricity usage is 152% of well managed schools which
 is above average, the school should aim to reduce this,
 which would save you &pound;38,000 (250,000kWh) per year if you matched the most energy efficient (exemplar) schools.
 </p>
 <p>
 Whether you have old or new school buildings, good energy management and best
 practice in operation can save significant amounts of energy. With good management
 an old building can use significantly less energy than a poorly managed new building.
 Improving controls, upgrading to more efficient lighting and other measures are
 applicable to all school buildings.

 </p> <h2>How your electricity varies throughout the year</h2>
 <p>
 The graph below shows how your electricity consumption varies throughout the year.
 Each bar represents a whole week and the split between holiday, weekend and school day open and closed consumption for that week.
 It highlights how electricity consumption generally increases in the winter and is lower in the summer.
 </p> <p>
 The colouring on the graph also highlights electricity usage over holidays in red.
 Holiday usage is normally caused by appliances and computers being left on (called 'baseload').
 The school should aim to reduce this baseload (which also occurs at weekends
 and overnight during school days) as this will have a big impact on a school's energy costs.
 Sometime this can be achieved by switching appliances off on Fridays before weekends and holidays,
 and sometimes by replacing older electrical appliances with more efficient new ones.
 </p>
 <p>
 For example replacing 2 old ICT servers which run a schools computer network which perhaps
 consume 1,500 watts of electricity, to a single more efficient server consuming 500 watts
 would reduce power consumption by 1,000 watts (1.0 kW) on every day of the year.
 This would save 1kW x 24 hours per day x 365 days per year = 8,760 kWh. Each kWh of electricity
 costs about 15p, so this would save 8,760 x 15p = &pound;1,300 per year. If the new server lasted
 5 years then that would be a &pound;5,250 saving to the school which is far more than the
 likely &pound;750 cost of the new server!
 </p> <h2>How your electricity usage has changed over the last few years</h2>
 <p>
 This chart shows your electricity usage over the last few years, and how it has changed.
 </p> <p>
 Unless the school has had additional buildings added, if you are managing your electricity
 consumption well this should show a downward trend; more modern ICT equipment,
 LED lighting and behavioural change all contribute to reducing electricity usage.
 </p> <p>
 This graph shows the same information as the graph above but in more detail:
 </p> <p>
 Can you spot any difference or changes that have occurred over the last few years?
 </p> <p>The graph below compares monthly electricity consumption over the two years.</p> <p>
 This graph allows you to see long term trends in energy use.
 It can be a quick way to spot whether energy saving behaviour
 and lighting and equipment updates are having an impact on your electricity consumption.
 You need to be careful when comparing months with holidays, particularly Easter,
 which some years is in March and other times in April.
 </p>
 <p>
 Try comparing the monthly consumption over the last 2 years
 to see if there are any differences which you can explain?
 </p> <p>
 The chart below provides a comparison with
 &apos;benchmark&apos; and &apos;exemplar&apos; schools,
 allowing you to see how your school compares with other energy
 efficient schools. You can click on the chart to drilldown to
 individual days and work out at what times of day and year
 your school is doing either better or worse than these schools.
 </p>
 <p>
 A &apos;benchmark&apos; school represents the
 30.0&percnt; best ranked secondary schools
 and &apos;exemplar&apos; the
 17.5&percnt; best secondary schools.
 </p> <p>
 Look at the chart carefully, at what time of year and day is
 your school above the chart - is there something you
 can do like turning equipment off to reduce your consumption
 to match these schools? Are there any anomalies like jumps
 in usage outside school hours which you can&apos;t account for?
 <p><p>
 This chart shows when you have used electricity over the past 12 months.
 63% of your electricity usage is out of hours:
 which is well above the average
 of 50%.
 The best schools only consume 35% out of hours.
 Reducing your school's out of hours usage to 35%
 would save &pound;20,000 (130,000kWh) per year.
 This saving is equivalent to the cost of fuel to drive a battery electric car 770,000 km <button class="btn btn-secondary" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-placement="top" data-title="How we calculate this" data-content="Electricity costs schools about Â£0.15 per kWh.

 </p> <h2> Your electricity usage by day of the week </h2>
 <p>
 The graph below shows your electricity use broken down by
 day of the week over the last 12 months:
 </p> <p>
 There will be some electricity usage at weekends from appliances and devices
 left on, but the school should aim to minimise these. Schools with low weekend
 electricity consumption aim to switch as many appliances off as possible
 on a Friday afternoon, sometimes providing the caretaker or cleaning
 staff with a checklist as to what they should be turning off.
 </p><h2>Electricity Baseload (all meters)</h2> 
      <p>
        Your electricity baseload over the last
        12 months
        was 23 kW.
        Other schools with a similar number of pupils have a baseload of 24 kW.
      <p>
     
      <p>
        Electricity baseload is the electricity needed to provide power to appliances
        that keep running at all times.
        It can be measured by looking at your school&apos;s out of hours electricity consumption.
      <p>
     
      <p>
        
          Your school&apos;s baseload is low, which is good and as a result you are saving
          &pound;1,100 per year versus
          the average of other schools of a similar size.
        

        
          However, you could still improve by matching the baseload
          of the best performing schools saving
          &pound;12,000 per year.
        
      </p>

     <h2>Electricity Baseload - Longer Term (all meters)</h2> 
      <p>
        This chart shows you the same chart as above but for all the
        data we have available for you school - so you can see longer term
        trends in your baseload.
      <p>
     
      <p>
        You would expect baseload to reduce over
        time as appliances and computers have become more power efficient
        with lower standby power requirements.
        If this is not the case then
        you should look to identify the cause of the increase; you can
        use appliance monitors to determine the standby power of individual
        appliances - why not get the pupils to complete a survey?

        Reducing a school's baseload is often the fastest way of reducing a school's energy costs
        and reducing its carbon footprint. At a well-managed school the baseload should remain the same
        throughout the year. Every 1 kW of baseload reduced will save a school Â£1,300 per year,
        and reduce its carbon footprint by 1,800 kg.
      </p>
     
      <h3>Common causes</h3>
      A high baseload is often caused by:
      <ul>
        <li>Old freezers and fridges running constantly</li>
        <li>Inefficient IT servers</li>
        <li>Security lights</li>
        <li>Electric water heaters</li>
        <li>Water chillers</li>
        <li>Air conditioning</li>
        <li>Computers, whiteboards and other electrical equipment left running when the school is closed.</li>
      </ul>
     
      <h3>What you should do</h3>
      To fully determine the causes of your baseload usage you need to do a survey of what
        appliances are being left on overnight and their power consumption.
      <ul>
        <li>Find out whether any electrical equipment or lights are running all the time.
            Do they need to run all the time?</li>
        <li>You should check to see what lights and appliances are left on at the end of the school day
            and get pupils and staff to switch off lights and appliances when they go home,
            and before the school holidays. Don't forget to look in offices or school kitchens.</li>
        <li>Use appliance monitors to check how much energy your school fridges and freezers are using,
            as these need to run all the time. A modern fridge or freezer uses Â£35 to Â£45 of electricity a year,
            but old models can use up to Â£600 of electricity a year.</li>
        <li>Consider replacing old ICT servers with modern servers or move to saving your school's
            data in the 'cloud'. Removing the need for school ICT servers can also save energy previously
            used for air conditioning in school server rooms.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are a number of activities which can help you track down your baseload consumption:

    </li><li> 
      <a href="https://energysparks.uk/activity_types/47" target ="_blank">Carry out a spot check to see if lights or electrical items are left on after school</a>
    </li></ul>

    <h2>How your electricity usage has changed over the last few years</h2>
 <p>
 This chart shows your electricity usage over the last few years, and how it has changed.
 </p> <p>
 Unless the school has had additional buildings added, if you are managing your electricity
 consumption well this should show a downward trend; more modern ICT equipment,
 LED lighting and behavioural change all contribute to reducing electricity usage.
 </p> <h2>How your electricity varies throughout the year</h2>
 <p>
 The graph below shows how your electricity consumption varies throughout the year.
 Each bar represents a whole week and the split between holiday, weekend and school day open and closed consumption for that week.
 It highlights how electricity consumption generally increases in the winter and is lower in the summer.
 </p> <p>
 The colouring on the graph also highlights electricity usage over holidays in red.
 Holiday usage is normally caused by appliances and computers being left on (called 'baseload').
 The school should aim to reduce this baseload (which also occurs at weekends
 and overnight during school days) as this will have a big impact on a school's energy costs.
 Sometime this can be achieved by switching appliances off on Fridays before weekends and holidays,
 and sometimes by replacing older electrical appliances with more efficient new ones.
 </p>
 <p>
 For example replacing 2 old ICT servers which run a schools computer network which perhaps
 consume 1,500 watts of electricity, to a single more efficient server consuming 500 watts
 would reduce power consumption by 1,000 watts (1.0 kW) on every day of the year.
 This would save 1kW x 24 hours per day x 365 days per year = 8,760 kWh. Each kWh of electricity
 costs about 15p, so this would save 8,760 x 15p = &pound;1,300 per year. If the new server lasted
 5 years then that would be a &pound;5,250 saving to the school which is far more than the
 likely &pound;750 cost of the new server!
 </p> <p>
 This graph shows the same information as the graph above but in more detail:
 </p> <p>
 Can you spot any difference or changes that have occurred over the last few years?
 </p> <p>The graph below compares monthly electricity consumption over the two years.</p> <p>
 This graph allows you to see long term trends in energy use.
 It can be a quick way to spot whether energy saving behaviour
 and lighting and equipment updates are having an impact on your electricity consumption.
 You need to be careful when comparing months with holidays, particularly Easter,
 which some years is in March and other times in April.
 </p>
 <p>
 Try comparing the monthly consumption over the last 2 years
 to see if there are any differences which you can explain?
 </p><p>
 This chart compares your electricity usage over the last 2 weeks:
 </p>  <p>
 The graph below shows how the electricity consumption varies
 during the day over the last 7 days.
 </p>
 <p>
 You can use this type of graph to understand how the schools electricity usage changes
 over time.

 </p> <p>
 Electricity baseload is the electricity needed to provide power to appliances that keep running at all times.
 It can be measured by looking at your school's out of hours electricity consumption.
 The graph below shows how your school's electricity 'baseload'
 has varied over time:
 </p> <p>Your electricity baseload is good </p>
 <p>
 Your baseload over the last year of 23 kW is good
 compared with average usage at other schools of 24 kW (pupil based),
 and 14 kW at an exemplar school.
 </p>
 <p>
 Reducing a school's baseload is often the fastest way of reducing a school's energy costs
 and reducing its carbon footprint. For each 1kW reduction in baseload, the school will save
 &pound;1,050 per year, and reduce its carbon footprint by 2,400 kg.
 </p>
 <p>
 Look carefully at the graph above, how has the baseload changed over time?
 Does it change seasonally (from summer to winter)? There should be very
 little difference between summer and winter electricity baseload, unless
 there is something not working properly at the school, for example
 electrical heating left on accidentally?
 </p><h2>School days</h2>
 <p>
 This graph compares the average electricity consumption
 at the school during the last 2 years on school days. 
 It shows the peak electricity usage at the school (normally during
 the middle of the day) and the overnight electricity consumption.
 </p> <p>
 It is useful in diagnosing what changes have happened over the
 the last year which may have changed electricity consumption.
 </p>
 <p>
 At most schools the overnight consumption between 7:00pm in the
 evening and 6:00am in the morning is relatively constant. Is this
 the case at you school? There are a few reasons why there might
 be a small change during the night e.g. central heating boiler
 pumps sometimes runing on cold nights in the winter (frost protection)
 but any significant change should be investigated as you might be
 able to save electricity and costs through fixing the problem.
 </p>
 <p>
 During the day electricity power consumption rises rapidly and
 often peaks around midday.
 </p>
 <p>
 See if you can spot some of the following typical characteristics in the
 chart:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 Electricity consumption starting to increase from about 7:00am
 when the school opens, and lights and computers are switched
 on rapidly increasing consumption. What time does your school
 open and who is first to arrive?
 </li>
 <li>
 Its often possible to see when cleaners arrive at the school,
 in some schools its in the morning before school opens,
 at others its in the evening after school closes. Can you
 spot the cleaners on the chart? Its common for cleaners to
 switch all the school lights on; its possible to save electricity
 by asking them to only turn the lights on in the rooms they are cleaning
 </li>
 <li>
 The highest point on the charts is often around lunchtime
 when all the school lights and computers are switched on.
 You can often see a peak between 11:30am and 1:00pm when
 hot plates are switched on for school meals. Can you see
 a jump in consumption of between 2kW and 4kW at this time
 which might be the hot plates?
 </li>
 <li>
 After the school closes there should be a gradual reduction
 in electricity consumption as teachers leave and lights
 and computers are switched off
 </li>
 <li>
 Sometimes there is a regular evening event which increases consumption
 </li>
 </ul> <p>
 The chart below provides a comparison of your school&apos;s consumption
 during school days with
 &apos;benchmark&apos; and &apos;exemplar&apos; schools,
 allowing you to see how your school compares with other energy
 efficient schools. You can click on the chart to drilldown to
 individual days and work out at what times of day and year
 your school is doing either better or worse than these schools.
 </p>
 <p>
 A &apos;benchmark&apos; school represents the
 30.0&percnt; best ranked secondary schools
 and &apos;exemplar&apos; the
 17.5&percnt; best secondary schools.
 </p> <p>
 Look at the chart carefully, at what time of day is
 your school above the chart - is there something you
 can do like turning equipment off to reduce your consumption
 to match these schools? Are there any anomalies like jumps
 in usage outside school hours which you can&apos;t account for?
 <p> <h2>Holidays</h2>
 <p>
 This graph compares the average electricity consumption
 at the school during the last 2 years during the holidays. 
 </p> <p>
 The graph above shows consumption during the holidays. At most schools this
 should be relatively constant during the holidays, unless:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 The school is occupied during the holidays when consumption might increase
 during the day
 </li>
 <li>
 The school has solar panels which might cause consumption to drop
 during the middle of the day when the sun is out
 </li>
 <li>
 Electrical hot water heaters left on during the holidays causing
 peaks in consumption often in the morning, but sometimes throughout the day.
 </li>
 <li>
 The school has security lights which causes consumption to rise
 overnight when the sun goes down
 </li>
 <li>
 The school has electrical water heaters running through the weekend,
 which will cause peaks in consumption often in the morning, but
 sometimes throughout the day.
 </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Can you see any of these characteristics at your school
 in the graph above?
 </p> <h2>Weekends</h2>
 <p>
 This graph compares the average electricity consumption
 at the school during the last 2 years at the weekend. 
 </p> <p>
 The graph above shows consumption at the weekend. At most schools this
 should be relatively constant at the weekend, unless:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>
 The school is occupied at the weekend when consumption might increase
 during the day
 </li>
 <li>
 The school has solar panels which might cause consumption to drop
 during the middle of the day when the sun is out
 </li>
 <li>

 </p><h2>Benefits of installing solar PV</h2> 
      <p>
        Installing solar pv at your school will reduce the electricity you consume from the national grid,
        and reduce your school&apos;s carbon emissions. It should be seen as an addition to reducing
        your school&apos;s electricity consumption through energy efficiency rather than an alternative.
        Economically, following the removal of subsidies from solar panels it might take
        between 10 and 15 years to payback the capital costs of installing solar panels, but
        PTAs will often be prepared to raise some of the capital costs making it more economic for schools.
      <p>
     
      <p>
        The table below provides estimates of the potential benefits and costs of
        installing different quantities of solar pv panels at your school:

      <p>
        The table contains a range of capacities, calculated using half hourly electricity
        meter data from your school and real solar pv data for your locality for the last year
        to produce a reasonable estimate of the potential for solar pv to reduce your
        main consumption. Energy Sparks has estimated that installing
        250 kWp provides the
        best payback. However, installing slightly more or less than the best payback
        makes little difference to the economics.

        <li>
          The calculations currently assume you will get some income from any
          exported electricity. Since the end of the Feed-In-Tariff in April 2019 there has
          been no replacement scheme to provide income from exported electricity. The
          government have proposed a Smart Export Guarantee (SEG) scheme, but
          it is not in place yet (as of Nov 2019) but some suppliers are
          already offering to pay you for any exported electricity.
        </li>
        <li>
          The calculations are based on a current electricity price of 15p/kWh,
          if mains electricity prices reduce there will be a lower economic benefit and
          longer payback to the installation.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the school becomes more efficient at using electricity and reduces its electricity
          consumption the benefit will also reduce.
        </li>
        <li>
          The capital costs in the table above are estimates based on
          current market rates; an installation cost at your
          school might be a little different.
        </li>
        <li>
          The estimates assume your have roof space and that is it roughly
          south facing - as this is optimal for schools whose peak demand is
          during the middle of the day when south facing panels produce the most electricity.
        </li>
        <li>
          The benefits of your solar pv will be reduced if you make your school more energy efficient.
          However, if you want your school to reduce its carbon emissions you should consider 
          both installing solar panels and reducing your electricity consumption.
        </li>

        Your school has multiple electricity underlying meters.

        The chart below provides a weekly breakdown of the energy used by
        each underlying meter. Clicking on the chart columns allows you to

        Having multiple meters can help you understand your energy use better,
        however, there is a significant standing charge for each meter of more than 
        &pound; 1,000 per year, so there is potential for saving by consolidating meters.

                  which means your billing won't be accurate. To edit your tariffs go to the

      <div class="content">
     
    <p>
      Energy Sparks calculates electricity and gas costs using 2 different
      methods:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. <strong>Economic Costs</strong>:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          this assumes a simple cost model, with electricity costing 15p/kWh
          and gas 3p/kWh
        </li>
        <li>
          generally, this method is used when information is presented to
          pupils because it is easy to understand, and allows them to do simple maths
          converting between kWh and &#163;
        </li>
        <li>
          we also use it for economic forecasting, when doing cost benefit
          analysis for suggested improvements to your energy management, as it better
          represents future energy prices/tariffs than your current potentially
          volatile tariffs as these can change from year to year
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      2. <strong>Accounting Costs</strong>:
    </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These represent your real energy costs and represent all the
            different types of standing charges applied to your account
          </li>
          <li>
            To do this we need to know what these tariffs are, sometimes these
            can be provided by all schools by a local authority, and sometimes you will
            need to provide us the information is not available from the Local
            Authority. MAT or Energy Supplier
          </li>
          <li>
            We can use this more accurate tariff information to provide more
            detailed advice on potential cost savings through tariff changes or meter
            consolidation
          </li>
        </ul>
   
      </div>
    <h2>Refrigeration</h2> 
        <p>
          This benchmark looks at any overnight reduction in electricity consumption
          during the last summer holidays and assumes this is mainly from refrigeration
          being turned off, using this information to assess the efficiency of schools&apos
          refrigeration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The analysis is experimental and can create false positives.
          If no impact is detected either the school didn&apos;t
          turn their fridges and freezers off during the summer holidays
          or they are very efficient with very little reduction.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a potential saving is identified then
          <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/electricity-usage-monitor/s?k=electricity+usage+monitor"  target="_blank">appliance monitors</a>
          can be used to determine which fridge or freezer is most inefficient and would be economic to replace
          (please see the case study on Energy Sparks homepage
            <a href="https://energysparks.uk/case-studies"  target="_blank">here</a>
          ).
        </p>
      <p>
 Acme Academy is a secondary school near Acme AB1 2CD
 with 961 pupils
 and a floor area of 5932m<sup>2</sup>.
 </p>
 <p>
 Your school spent &pound;17,000 (580,000kWh) on gas last year.
 The gas usage is more than well managed schools which spent &pound;15,000: 
 </p> <p>
 Your gas usage is 114% of well managed schools which
 is above average, the school should aim to reduce this,
 which would save you &pound;3,300 (110,000kWh) per year if you matched the most energy efficient (exemplar) schools.
 </p>
 <p>
 Whether you have old or new school buildings, good energy management and best
 practice in operation can save significant amounts of energy. With good management
 an old building can use significantly less energy than a poorly managed new building.
 Improving controls, upgrading to more efficient lighting and other measures are
 applicable to all school buildings.
 </p> <h2>How your gas varies throughout the year</h2>
 <p>
 The graph below shows how your gas consumption varies throughout the year.
 Each bar represents a whole week and the split between holiday, weekend and school day open and closed consumption for that week.
 It highlights how gas consumption generally increases in the winter and is lower in the summer.
 </p>
 <p>
 The blue line on the graph shows the number of 'degrees days' which is a measure of how cold
 it was during each week. Degree days are the inverse of temperature.
 The higher the degree days the lower the temperature. See a more detailed -
 <a href="https://www.sustainabilityexchange.ac.uk/files/degree_days_for_energy_management_carbon_trust.pdf" target="_blank">explanation here</a> .
 If the heating boiler is working well at your school the blue line should track the gas usage quite closely.
 Look along the graph, does the usage (bars) track the degree days well?
 </p> <p>
 The colouring on the graph also demonstrates whether heating and hot water
 were left on in the holidays.
 Try looking along the graph for the holidays highlighted in red
 - during which holidays was gas being consumed?
 Generally gas heating and hot water should be turned off during holidays.
 It isn't necessary to leave everything on,
 and if someone is working in the school it is more efficient
 just to heat that room with a fan heater or similar than the whole school.
 More than half of schools leave their heating on on Christmas Day
 - did your school do this, and was there anyone at school then?
 </p>
 <p>
 Sometimes the school building manager or caretaker is concerned about the school getting too cold
 and causing frost damage. This is a very rare event, and because most school boilers can be programmed
 to automatically turn on in very cold weather (called 'frost protection') it is unnecessary
 to leave the boiler on all holiday. If the school boiler doesn't have automatic
 'frost protection' then the thermostat at the school should be turned down as low as possible to 8C
 - this will save 70% of the gas compared with leaving the thermostat at 20C.
 </p> <h2>How your gas usage has changed over the last few years</h2>
 <p>
 This chart shows your gas usage over the last few years, and how it has changed.
 </p> <p>
 Reducing gas consumption can be achieved by turning your school's thermostat down,
 reducing out of hours usage, insulating your buildings or installing a new more efficient
 gas boiler.
 </p> <p>
 This graph shows the same information as the graph above but in more detail:
 </p> <p>
 Can you spot any difference or changes that have occurred over the last few years?
 </p><p>
 This chart shows when you have used gas over the past 12 months.
 59% of your gas usage is out of hours:
 which is above the average
 of 50%.
 The best schools only consume 30% out of hours.
 Reducing your school's out of hours usage to 30%
 would save &pound;5,100 (170,000kWh) per year.
 This saving is equivalent to the gas consumption of 12 homes <button class="btn btn-secondary" data-toggle="popover" data-container="body" data-placement="top" data-title="How we calculate this" data-content="A average uk home uses 14,000 kWh of gas Therefore 170,000 kWh &divide; 14,000 kWh/Homes gas = 12 homes (gas usage) "> See how we calculate this</button>

 </p> <h2> Your gas usage by day of the week </h2>
 <p>
 The graph below shows your gas use broken down by
 day of the week over the last 12 months:
 </p> <p>
 For most schools there should be no gas usage at weekends. The only reason gas
 might be used is for frost protection in very cold weather,
 and averaged across the whole year this should be a very small
 proportion of weekly usage
 </p>
 <p>
 For some schools there is more gas consumption on a Monday and Tuesday than Wednesday,
 Thursday and Friday, as additional energy is required to heat a school up after the heating
 is left off at weekends.
 This energy is being absorbed into the masonry.
 </p>
 <p>
 'Thermal mass' describes a material's capacity to absorb, store and release heat.
 For example, concrete has a high capacity to store heat and is referred to as a
 'high thermal mass' material. Insulation foam,
 by contrast, has very little heat storage capacity
 and is referred to as having 'low thermal mass'.
 </p>
 <p>
 Can you see this pattern at your school from the graph above?<br>
 It's still much more efficient to turn the heating off over the weekend,
 and use a little more energy on Monday and Tuesday than it is to leave
 the heating on all weekend.
 </p>
 <p>
 If the graph shows high weekend gas consumption, ask your caretaker or building manager
 to check your heating system controls. You may have:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>incorrect or faulty frost protection</li>
 <li>lack a 7 day timer so it is not possible to turn the heating off at weekends</li>
 <li>incorrect boiler settings</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 By eliminating weekend gas consumption at your school you could save up to
 &pound;1,200 (41,000kWh) per year.
 </p> <p>
 This graph shows how the gas consumption of the school varies on school days when the heating is on in the winter (aggregated across the whole year):
 </p> <p>
 It&apos;s a useful graph for determining how well controlled the timing of the boiler is.
 A well timed boiler should only come on at about 6:00am in the morning
 to get the school up to temperature by 8:00am, and then turn off again about half
 an hour before the school closes.
 </p>
 <p>
 Does your school&apos;s boiler in the graph above do this?
 If it doesn't you might need to speak to your building manager
 or caretaker and ask why? 
 </p><h2>How your gas usage has changed over the last few years</h2>
 <p>
 This chart shows your gas usage over the last few years, and how it has changed.
 </p> <p>
 Reducing gas consumption can be achieved by turning your school's thermostat down,

 This graph shows the same information as the graph above but in more detail:
 </p> <p>
 Can you spot any difference or changes that have occurred over the last few years?
 </p><p>
 This chart shows you how much your school&apos;s gas consumption has changed
 in the last two weeks. It adjusts the gas consumption for outside temperature,
 removing the effect of changes in outside temperature. This should make it easier to
 see the impact of changes you might be making in boiler control:
 </p>  <p>
 This chart allows you to see when your boiler has been turning on and off
 over the last week and how much power (gas)
 it has been consuming in &apos;kilowatts&apos; (kW):
 </p> <p>
 By clicking the legend at the bottom of the chart, you can turn the lines
 on the chart on and off for individual days &hyphen; making it easier to understand
 what is going on at the school.
 </p>
 <p>
 In a school with a heating system that is working well (good boiler, good pipework
 for heat distribution, large enough radiators, and reasonable insulation),
 you might expect the heating to turn on at about 6am, and peak for the next
 2 hours while the school is being heated up, and then gradually reduce during the day.
 In most schools the heat generated by electrical equipment and 30 pupils in a class room
 would suggest classrooms need very little additional heating from the school&apos;s boiler,
 once the pupils arrive.
 </p>
 <p>
 If the boiler has &apos;optimal start control&apos; configured, you might notice the start time of
 the boiler changing automatically &hyphen; from perhaps 6:30am in milder weather to earlier
 e.g. 4:30pm in colder weather. In very cold weather you might notice the heating coming on &apos;at random&apos;
 â this is most likely frost protection &hyphen; the boiler turning the heating system on to stop
 the school&apos;s pipework freezing.
 </p> <p>
 The remainder of the charts on this page are designed to allow you to see
 the detail of your recent gas consumption. This is particularly useful if
 you are trying to make improvements in the control of your boiler to save energy.
 </p>
 <p>
 This first chart shows the daily gas consumption over the last 2 weeks
 including the outside temperature:
 </p> <p>
 Typically, your gas consumption should vary with outside temperature,
 the colder it is the more gas you will consume, for example normally
 twice as much gas might be consumed if the outside temperature is 0C,
 versus 10C. So, sometimes it can be difficult to see from this chart
 whether changes you have been making to the boiler have made a difference
 because outside temperature might be a more dominant effect. The next two
 charts try to isolate the effect of outside temperature
 </p> <p>
 This chart is identical to the previous chart but replaces temperature
 with degree days. Degree days &hyphen; how cold it is, increases as it gets colder
 and makes it easier to see gas consumption increasing with coldness
 (an explanation of degree days appears above under &apos;By Week: Gas&apos;).
 </p> <p>
 You should be able to see the gas consumption increasing and decreasing
 with degree days. Any change from this tracking (correlation) might be
 the impact of recent changes being made to boiler control, or because you
 have poor thermostatic control in your school. This means your heating controls
 are not adjusting the boiler in response to changes in temperature.
 </p> <p>
 This chart is temperature compensated as per the chart above, but shows a
 longer&hyphen;term view of any changes in the schoolâs gas consumption:
 </p> <h2>Breakdown of underlying meters</h2> 
      <p>
        Your school has multiple gas underlying meters.

        The chart below provides a weekly breakdown of the energy used by
        each underlying meter. Clicking on the chart columns allows you to
        drilldown to more detailed data, clicking on the legend allows you to
        add and remove meters.

        Having multiple meters can help you understand your energy use better,
        however, there is a significant standing charge for each meter of more than 
        &pound; 1,000 per year, so there is potential for saving by consolidating meters.

      <div class="content">
     
    <p>
      Energy Sparks calculates electricity and gas costs using 2 different
      methods:
    </p>
    <p>
      1. <strong>Economic Costs</strong>:
    </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          this assumes a simple cost model, with electricity costing 15p/kWh
          and gas 3p/kWh
        </li>
        <li>
          generally, this method is used when information is presented to
          pupils because it is easy to understand, and allows them to do simple maths
          converting between kWh and &#163;
        </li>
        <li>
          we also use it for economic forecasting, when doing cost benefit
          analysis for suggested improvements to your energy management, as it better
          represents future energy prices/tariffs than your current potentially
          volatile tariffs as these can change from year to year
        </li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      2. <strong>Accounting Costs</strong>:
    </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            These represent your real energy costs and represent all the
            different types of standing charges applied to your account
          </li>
          <li>
            To do this we need to know what these tariffs are, sometimes these
            can be provided by all schools by a local authority, and sometimes you will
            need to provide us the information is not available from the Local
            Authority. MAT or Energy Supplier
          </li>
          <li>
            We can use this more accurate tariff information to provide more
            detailed advice on potential cost savings through tariff changes or meter
            consolidation
          </li>
        </ul>
   
      </div>
    <p>
 Hot water in schools is generally provided by a central gas boiler which
 then continuously circulates the hot water in a loop around the school.
 Sometimes these gas-based systems are supplemented by more local
 electrically powered immersion or point of use heaters.
 </p>
 <p>
 The circulatory gas-based systems in schools are generally very
 inefficient, averaging about 15&percnt; &semi; for your school we estimate
 39%.
 These inefficiencies offer significant cost and carbon emission saving
 opportunities if addressed.
 </p>
 <p>
 These systems are inefficient because they circulate hot water permanently
 in a loop around the school so hot water is immediately available when
 someone turns on a tap rather than having to wait for the hot water to come
 all the way from the boiler room. The circulatory pipework used to do this
 is often poorly insulated and loses heat. Often these types of systems are
 only 15% efficient compared with direct point of use water heaters which
 are often over 90% efficient. Replacing the pipework insulation is generally
 not a cost-efficient investment.
 </p>
 <p>
 This section of the dashboard analyses the efficiency of your
 school&apos;s hot water usage and the potential savings from either improving
 the timing control of your existing hot water system or replacing it
 completely with point of use electric hot water systems.
 </p>
 <h2>Estimate of the efficiency of your hot water system using smart meter data</h2>
 <p>
 The graph below attempts to analyse your school&apos;s hot water system by
 looking at the heating over the course of the summer, just before and
 during the start of the summer holidays. If the hot water has been
 accidentally left on during the summer holidays, it is possible to see how
 efficient the hot water system is by comparing the difference in
 consumption between occupied and unoccupied days:

 The data for your school using the information on the chart above
 implies the following for your current hot water system:

 <h2>Theoretical estimate of required energy to heat your school&apos;s hot water</h2>
 <p>
 Theoretically every pupil uses about 5 litres of hot water per day, which
 for your school with 961 pupils,
 equates to 936,975 litres of hot water over the 190 days
 of the school year. In a 100% efficient system about 27,000 kWh of energy is
 required each year to heat this hot water.
 </p>
 <p>
 This calculation of 27,000 kWh for a 100&percnt; efficient
 system compares with Energy Sparks&apos; estimate of
 70,000 kWh for your current system.
 </p>
 <h2>Investment Choices</h2>
 <p>
 Generally, there are two potential options you might have to reduce the
 costs and carbon emissions of running the hot water system at your school;
 improving the timing control of your existing system or replacing it with
 point of use electrical heaters.
 </p>
 <p>

 <p>
 This is only an approximate estimate as Energy Sparks can only imply this
 based on a generic school of the same size as yours and the information
 provided by your school&apos;s smart meter data, but it should provide an
 indication whether investments of this type are worthwhile investigating
 further?
 </p>
 <p>
 The &apos;Improved boiler control&apos; option involves changing the
 timing of your existing boiler potentially at no cost to the school.
 This involves reducing the time the hot water is heated to
 school hours and turning it off during weekends and holidays will save you
 about &pound;590 year and reduce your carbon
 emissions by 4,200 kg CO2
 (28&percnt;).
 </p>
 <p>
 The &apos;Point of use electric heater&apos; option,
 typically leads to the largest savings,
 perhaps -&pound;2,900 per year for your school,
 and a more significant reduction in carbon emissions of
 (9,600 kg CO2/
 66&percnt;),
 but for most schools it does require a significant capital investment.
 </p><h2>All school meters aggregated:</h2> <p>
 This graph shows how the gas consumption of the school varies on school days when the heating is on in the winter (aggregated across the whole year):
 </p> <p>
 It&apos;s a useful graph for determining how well controlled the timing of the boiler is.
 A well timed boiler should only come on at about 6:00am in the morning
 to get the school up to temperature by 8:00am, and then turn off again about half
 an hour before the school closes.
 </p>
 <p>
 Does your school&apos;s boiler in the graph above do this?
 If it doesn't you might need to speak to your building manager
 or caretaker and ask why? 
 </p> <h4>Optimum Start Control? Or, is your boiler turning on too early or being left on too late??</h4>
 <p>
 Most modern commercial boilers used in schools support 'optimum start control' - this is
 where the boiler controller learns over time how long it takes to heat up a school
 depending on how cold it is outside and inside. This allows the boiler to be turned
 on later in the morning (e.g. 06:00am) in milder weather saving energy and earlier (e.g. 04:00am)
 in colder weather. Without this type of control's schools often set their heating
 to come on at a fixed time, often earlier in the day (e.g. 04:00am) just in case
 the weather is cold, but this is unnecessarily early in mild weather and wastes energy.
 </p>
 <p>
 If your boiler has optimum start control which is working well it could save
 up to 20% of your school's heating costs.
 </p>
 <p>
 However, optimum start control often goes wrong and starts the heating far too early in
 the morning wasting even more energy than those schools without it.
 </p>
 <p>
 The chart below compares 5 days with a range of temperatures:
 </p> <p>
 You can click on the legend on the chart to add and remove days.
 </p>
 <p>
 Does your school have optimum start control? If it does you would expect the boiler
 to start later on the milder day? Does it start earlier on the colder day?
 </p>
 <p>
 This graph is also useful in determining whether your boiler is starting at a reasonable
 time in the morning. It depends a little on the school, but for these 2 days you might expect
 the boiler to start at 5:30am on the colder day and perhaps 06:30am on the milder day. Is this
 the case for your school?
 </p>
 <p>
 Is the heating also turning off at a reasonable time, perhaps half an hour before school closing time?
 The school could save energy by ensuring the boiler turns off at the right time.
 </p>

      <h2>Thermostatic Control</h2>
     
      <p>
        The thermostatic control at your school is about average (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.67).
      </p>
     
      <h2>Why thermostatic control is important</h2>

      <p>
        A building with good thermostatic control means
        the heating system brings the temperature of the
        building up to the set temperature, and then maintains
        it at a constant level. The heating required and
        therefore gas consumption should vary linearly with
        how cold it is outside i.e. the colder it is outside
        the higher the gas consumption for heating.
      </p>

      <p>
        The heating system can then adjust for internal heat
        gains due to people, electrical equipment and sunshine
        warming the building. It can also adjust for losses due
        to ventilation. Poor thermostatic control is likely to
        cause poor thermal comfort (occupants feel too hot or too cold),
        and the thermal comfort is then often maintained by leaving
        windows open leading to excessive gas consumption and carbon emissions.
      </p>
     
      <h2>Reasons for poor thermostatic control</h2>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, many schools have poor thermostatic control.
        This can be due to poorly located boiler thermostats.
        A common location for a thermostat in schools is
        in the school hall or entrance lobby whose heating,
        internal gains and heat losses are not representative
        of the building as a whole, and particularly classrooms.
        Halls are often poorly insulated with few radiators
        which means they never get up to temperature, causing
        the boiler controller to run the boiler constantly which
        causes the better insulated classrooms to overheat,
        and more gas consumption than necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Poor thermostatic control can also be due to a lack
        of thermostatic controls in individual rooms,
        which leads to windows being opened to compensate.
        If itâs difficult to provide local thermostatic control
        in each room, for example Thermostatic Radiator Valves (TRVs)
        canât be installed on radiators you could ask your boiler
        engineers whether
        <strong>âweather compensationâ<!â technical term don't translate â></strong>,
        which reduces the temperature of the circulating central
        heating water in milder weather can be configured for your boiler as an alternative.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        The scatter chart above shows a thermostatic analysis
        of your school&apos;s heating system. The y axis shows
        the energy consumption in kWh on any given day.
        The x axis is the outside temperature.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the heating has good thermostatic control then
        the points at the top of chart when the heating
        is on should be close to
        the trend line. This is because the amount of heating
        required on a single day is linearly proportional to the
        difference between the inside and outside temperature,
        and any variation from the trend line would suggest
        thermostatic control isn&apos;t working too well.
      </p>

      <p>
        R<sup>2</sup> is a measure of how close to the trendline the daily
        heating values are. At your school this is 0.67
        which is <strong>about average</strong>,
        a value of 1.0 is perfect,
        0.0 indicates no relationship between how cold
        it is outside and how much gas is consumed which
        would be very bad for the schoolâs carbon emissions
        and running costs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two sets of data are provided on the chart.
        The points associated with the group at the top
        of the chart are those for winter school day heating.
        As it gets warmer the daily gas consumption drops.
      </p>
     
      
     
      <h2>How to calculate a theoretical daily gas consumption using the model</h2>

      <p>
        For energy experts, the formula which defines the trend line is very interesting.
        It predicts how the gas consumption varies with outside temperature.
      </p>

      <p>In the example above the formula for heating is:</p>

      <blockquote>predicted_heating_requirement = -326.1 * outside_temperature + 5812</blockquote>
      
      <p>
        So for your school if the average outside temperature is 12C
        the predicted gas consumption for the school would be
        -326.1 * 12.0 + 5812 = 1899 kWh for the day.
        Whereas if the outside temperature was colder at 4C the gas consumption would be
        -326.1 * 4.0 + 5812 = 4508 kWh.
        See if you can read these values off the trend line of the graph above
        (temperatures of 12C and 4C on the x axis and the answer - the predicted daily gas consumption on the y-axis).
      </p>

              the way Energy Sparks looks at thermostatic control

      <h2>Using days with large diurnal range to understand thermostatic control</h2>

      <p>
        An alternative way of looking at the thermostatic control is to
        look at whether a school&apos;s gas consumption changes on a day when
        the outside temperature changes significantly. It is common,
        particularly in Spring for outside temperatures to increase by
        more than 10C during the day (called a large diurnal temperature range,
        typically caused by cold ground temperatures after the winter reducing
        overnight temperatures, and warm Spring sunshine during the day).
      </ p> 

      <p>
        In theory if outside temperatures rise by 10C, then the heating loss
        through a building&apos;s fabric (walls, windows etc.) will more than
        halve (as the heat loss is proportional to the difference between outside
        and inside temperatures). If the school has good thermostatic control
        then you would expect so see a similar drop in gas consumption over the course of the day.
      </p>

    <p>
 'Frost Protection' is a feature built into most school boiler controllers
 which turns the heating on when it is cold outside in order to prevent
 frost damage to hot and cold water pipework.
 </p>
 <p>
 A well programmed control will turn the boiler on if a number of conditions are met, typically:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>The outside temperature is below 4C (the point at which water starts to freeze and expand)</li>
 <li>And, the internal temperature is below 8C</li>
 <li>And, for some controllers if the temperature of the water in the central heating system is below 2C</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 Typically, this means the 'frost protection' only turns the heating on if it is cold outside, AND
 the heating has been off for at least 24 hours - as it normally takes this long for a school to
 cool down and the internal temperature of the school to drop below 8C. So, in general in very cold weather
 the heating would probably not come on a Saturday, but on a Sunday when the school has cooled down
 sufficiently.
 </p>
 <p>
 Although 'frost protection' uses energy and therefore it costs money to run, it is cheaper than
 the damage which might be caused from burst pipes. Some schools don't have frost protection
 configured for their boilers, and although this saves money for most of the year, it is common
 for these schools to leave their heating on during winter holidays, which is significantly more expensive
 than if frost protection is allowed to provide the protection automatically.
 </p>
 <p>
 The graph below which is for the coldest weekend of recent years, attempts to demonstrate whether
 </p>
 <ol type="a">
 <li>Frost protection is configured for your school and</li>
 <li>whether it is configured correctly and running efficiently</li>
 </ol>
 <p>You can check another frosty weekend by clicking the move forward/back frosty day buttons</p> <p>
 The graph shows both the gas consumption (blue bars), and the outside temperature
 (dark blue line) on a cold weekend (Saturday through to Monday).
 If frost protection is working the heating (gas consumption) should come on when
 the temperature drops below 4C - but not immediately on the Saturday as the
 'thermal mass' of the building will mean the internal temperature stays above 8C
 for at least 24 hours after the school closed on a Friday.
 </p>
 <p>
 If the outside temperature rises above 4C, the heating should go off. The amount
 of gas consumption (blue bars) should be about half the consumption of a school
 day (e.g. the Monday), as the heating requirement is roughly proportional
 to the difference between the inside and outside temperatures, and because
 the school is only being heated to 8C rather than the 20C of a school
 day then much less energy will be used.
 </p>
 <p>
 Can you see any of these characteristics in the graph above, or the two other example
 graphs for your school below?

 you are seeing please <a href="mailto:hello@energysparks.uk?subject=Boiler Frost Protection&">contact us</a>
 and we will look for you, and let you know what we think.
 </p>
 <p>
 A working frost protection system can save a school money:
 </p>
 <ul>
 <li>Without frost protection, a school either risks pipework damage, or
 is forced to leave their heating on at maximum power over cold weeks and holidays</li>
 <li>Sometimes, frost protection is mis-configured, so comes on when the temperature is above 4C outside,
 or is configured to come on and bring the school up to too high a temperature e.g. 20C.</li>

      <p>
        Man-made carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions and other greenhouse
        gasses (e.g. methane CH<sub>4</sub>) are the primary cause of climate
        change. The emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere is causing the
        earth to warm up and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events.
        CO	<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere have

          increased by 30% in the last 50 years
        </a>
        as a result of man-made emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schools are a source of greenhouse gas emissions, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Transport</strong>
          : Most cars and buses used by pupils and staff to get to school use
          fossil fuels (petrol and diesel) and emit carbon dioxide and other
          pollutants from their exhausts
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Food</strong>
          : The production and transport of food eaten at lunchtime generates
          greenhouse gas emissions. A diet high in meat can generate a lot of
          greenhouse gases, as cows emit a lot of CO<sub>2</sub> and methane
          as a result of eating grass.
          A vegetarian diet has half the carbon emissions of meat-based diet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Electricity</strong>
          : The electricity used to power computers, lights and other appliances
          at the school is often generated in power stations
          which burn gas and coal (fossil fuels)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gas</strong>
          : The gas used to heat the school in the winter, to heat hot water and
          in cookers in the school kitchens, creates CO2 when it is burnt

      </ul>

      <h2>
        Carbon Emission Factors
      </h2>
      <p>
        To calculate the school's carbon emissions from the consumption of gas and
        electricity we need to know how much carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) is
        produced for every kWh of gas and electricity used by the school, these
        values are called 'emission factors', and they are different for gas and
        electricity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gas emissions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For gas the emissions are always the same; for every kWh of gas which is
        burnt in the school boilers 210g of CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted. CO	<sub>2</sub>
        is emitted as a result of burning gas (CH<sub>4</sub>) with
        oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), to produce carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) and
        water (H<sub>2</sub>0) (CH<sub>4</sub>
        + 4O<sub>2</sub> = CO<sub>2</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>O).
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if the school burns 1000 kWh of gas, it emits 1000 kWh * 210g /kWh =
        210,000g or 210kg of CO<sub>2</sub>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Electricity emissions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Electricity is more complicated as it varies continuously depending on what
        power sources are being used to supply the National Electricity Grid, these
        include power stations which burn coal and gas which have high emissions,
        and nuclear power stations, solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines
        which emit almost zero carbon when producing electricity. On a windy and
        sunny day when a larger proportion of the UK's electricity supply is from
        solar PV panels and wind turbines electricity emissions can be
        quite low at about 100g of CO<sub>2</sub> per kWh of electricity. On
        calm, cloudy days when most of the electricity is coming from gas and coal
        power stations as much as 400g of CO<sub>2</sub> is emitted for every 1 kWh
        of electricity production.
        <a href="https://carbonintensity.org.uk/" target="_blank">This link</a> shows
        a graph of the electricity grid's carbon emissions today and has a brief video
        explaining the variability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The amount of carbon dioxide emitted by the UK National Electricity Grid
        has significantly decreased over the last few year's as large number of
        solar PV panels and many offshore
        wind turbines have been installed replacing coal power stations which have
        been closed. Average annual emissions factors have decreased from 500g
        CO	<sub>2</sub> per kWh in 2012 to about 230g per kWh in 2019.

          Your School's Carbon Emissions over the last few years
        </h1>
        <p>
          This chart shows your school's carbon emissions over the last few years.
          Unless your school has managed to reduce its gas consumption you would
          expect carbon emissions from gas to have remained relatively constant.
          However, for electricity, as a result of the national electricity grid's
          decarbonisation, you would expect to see a decline in emissions.
          This has happened even without energy efficiency measures at school
          and is due to coal power stations being replaced with wind turbines.
          This chart shows your schools annual carbon emissions compared to an
          average and an exemplar school of the same size: 
        </p>
       
        <p>
          <strong>Question</strong>
          : What are the carbon emission trends at your school? How does you school's
          carbon emissions compare with exemplar (the best), and regional and
          national averages for schools or the same size of yours?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Question</strong>
          : Have both gas and electricity carbon emissions been reducing at your

        <p>

      <h2>
        Your School's Electricity Carbon Emissions over the last few years
      </h2>
      <p>
        This chart shows your school's electricity consumption over the last
        few years, with the average UK grid carbon intensity on the second y axis:
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Try switching between between the units (Change units: kWh, Â£ or kg CO2) and drilling
        down by clicking on the bars.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : By switching the Y axis between kWh and kg CO2 has your school
        reduced its carbon emissions more from reducing its electricity
        energy consumption (kWh) or from the National Electricity Grid decarbonisation?
      </p>
     
      <p>
        The chart below shows the carbon emissions from electricity consumption of
        your school over the last year. Generally emissions are higher
        during the winter as more electricity is used for lighting and sometimes
        for heating:
      </p>
     
      <p>
        The line (right hand axis) shows how the carbon emissions of the grid have
        varied in intensity as a result of the ever-changing mix of electricity
        sources on the grid. Generally, the intensity of the National Electricity
        Grid is higher in winter, when demand is highest and there are not enough
        renewable (wind, solar) and low carbon (nuclear) sources to satisfy demand,
        and when electricity from gas power stations which emit carbon must be
        turned on to meet this extra demand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : Can you see these trends in the chart above for your school?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : At what time of year do you think the most electricity is produced from
        wind turbines and solar PV? Are they at different times of the year?

      <h2>Variation in your school's electricity carbon emissions during the last week</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : How has the carbon intensity of the National Electricity Grid impacted
        the carbon emissions of your school this week? Compare it with your
        electricity consumption (in on this chart):
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Demand is generally highest on weekdays when people are at work and at
        school, but the intensity can be reduced if it is a sunny day in the summer
        from solar PV panels which are zero carbon reducing the need to produce
        electricity from gas power stations which emit a lot of carbon (about
        0.36kg/kWh).
      </p>
     
      <p>
        The graph below shows the carbon emissions (bar charts. Left hand axis)
        from your school as a result of electricity consumption over the last week,
        versus the carbon intensity of the National Electricity Grid (line, right
        hand axis):

      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : How much carbon has the intensity of the UK National Electricity Grid
        varied over the last week? What was the highest and lowest carbon
        intensities? Are the highest and lowest intensities at particular times
        during the week, when perhaps demand is highest and lowest?

      <div class="content">
     <h2>Your School's Gas Carbon Emissions over the last few years</h2> 
      <p>
        Gas is consumed by schools to provide heating in the winter, and for
        heating hot water, and kitchen usage all year round.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chart below shows your school's gas consumption over the last few
        years:
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Unlike the National Electricity Grid the carbon intensity of gas hasn't
        changed over many years; there are a few energy companies offering 'biogas'
        (typically gas from waste food or sewage), but this has very limited impact
        on the carbon emissions of gas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : Has your school's carbon emissions from gas changed in the last few
        years?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : How does the carbon emissions of gas compare with the carbon emissions of
        the electricity grid, today?
      </p>
     
      <p>
        As most gas in schools is consumed for heating, CO<sub>2</sub>
        emissions from the consumption of gas in school is greater during the
        winter than the summer.
      </p>
     
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>
        : As gas is a fossil fuel and the 'carbon factor' or emissions from
        burning 1 kWh of gas can't be reduced, how can the school reduce its gas
        emissions?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer</strong>
        : The only way for a school to reduce carbon emissions from its gas
        consumption is to use less gas: making sure the heating and hot water are
        not left on during holidays, weekends or school hours, and turning the
        thermostat down. An alternative might be to replace the gas boiler with and
        'air source heat pump' which uses electricity but emits much less carbon,
        but this can be expensive to install.

      <div class="content">
     
      <p>
        Electricity and gas are not the
        only carbon emissions from a school; transport and consumption of food also
        contribute. This should help you calculate the
        additional greenhouse gas emissions from transport and food to get an
        overview of your school's total carbon emissions and perhaps where there
        may be opportunities to reduce your emissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most schools about 30% of carbon emissions come from gas and
        electricity consumption, 30% from food and 30% from transport.
      </p>
      <p>
        To calculate your school's total carbon emissions, you will need to do some
        research:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Transport</strong>
          : You will need to find out how staff and pupils get to school, either
          my doing a survey, or by asking school management if a survey has been
          done in the past
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Food</strong>
          : You will need to count how many meals are eaten at school each day
          (normally one of each pupil and staff member), and how many of these
          are meat based, and how many vegetarians?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Gas and electricity</strong>
          : You just need to find the information on Energy Sparks
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once you have gathered the information you will then need to enter the data
        into this spreadsheet:
      </p>
     
      <iframe width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?resid=D22255E34EA12530%21278999&authkey=%21AA4vdwZUz8mhacQ&em=2&wdAllowInteractivity=False&AllowTyping=True&ActiveCell='Totals'!A1&wdHideGridlines=True&wdHideHeaders=True&wdDownloadButton=True&wdInConfigurator=True"></iframe>
       
      <p>
        It might be best if you download a copy of the spreadsheet (button bottom
        right), so you can save the information for future use. You need to fill in
        the information in the cells coloured orange which have been pre-populated
        for an example school with 400 pupils.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next section tells you how to gather the data required for each of the
        types of carbon emissions (gas, electricity, transport, food).
      </p>
     
      <h3>
        1. Transport
      </h3>
      <p>
        To calculate the 'transport' carbon emissions of a school you need to find
        out how people, both staff and pupils travel to school, and how far they
        travel. For this you might need to do a survey, or school management might
        already know if a 'Transport Survey' has already been carried out at a
        school.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to determine how everyone gets to school. The most important
        information to find is how many people travel to school by car and how far
        they travel, as cars generally generate the most carbon emissions,
        accounting for more than 90% of transport carbon emissions at most schools.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to find the following information for the spreadsheet (Transport
        Tab):

      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest way is to survey the staff, create a form containing 3 columns,

        You then need to calculate the number of staff travelling by each mode and
        the average distance for each Transport Mode - you might need to get a
        member of staff to help you with this. For the example above, you would
        need to enter under Staff - Petrol car: 2 staff (number) and an average
        distance of 11 miles (average of 10 and 12 miles), and under Staff - Bus: 1
        staff member and an average of 6 miles.
      </p>
      <p>
        To survey the figures for pupils you might need to survey pupils as they
        arrive at school but asking them to fill in a form for you, or you could
        print out and send a survey home.

      <h3>
        2. Food
      </h3>
      <p>
        Food is much easier to calculate. You just need to find out how many people
        eat meat-based meals at school each day and how many are vegetarian and
        enter them into the spreadsheet. Most people at the school will eat lunch
        every day, some will be supplied by the school kitchen (you could ask the
        kitchen staff how many meat based and vegetarian meals they serve each
        day), and also packed lunches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have gathered this information you simply enter the 2 numbers into
        the 'Food' tab of the spreadsheet.
      </p>
     
      <h2>
        3. Electricity and gas
      </h2>
      <p>
        Energy Sparks can calculate this for you automatically if there is at least
        a year of electricity and gas meter readings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Energy Sparks has calculated the following values for your school:
      </p>
      
        <p>
          &#183; Electricity: 88,000 kg CO2 /year
        </p>
      
      
        <p>
          &#183; Gas: 120,000 kg CO2 /year
        </p>
      
      <p>
        You just need to enter these values in the 'Electric+Gas' tab in the
        spreadsheet.
      </p>
     
      <h3>
        Totals
      </h3>
      <p>
          Once you have entered the information on the 3 tabs you can look at the
          result on the &#8216;Totals&#8217; tab. The pie chart should show about 30%
          of carbon emissions at your school coming from each of transport, food and
          energy (electricity and gas).

      <h2>
        Devising a strategy for reducing your school's carbon emissions
      </h2>
      <p>
        After calculating your school's current carbon emissions,
        perhaps you could consider how you might help
        the school reduce its carbon emissions and reduce the impact of global
        warming?
      </p>
      <p>
        Suggestions include:
      </p>
      <p>
        1. <strong>Transport</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        &#183; Getting more people to walk, cycle and take the bus to school and
        fewer driving (which also causes air pollution which is bad for your
        health)
      </p>
      <p>
        &#183; Car sharing: sharing a car reduces per person carbon emissions
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Switching from petrol to electric cars (you could try
            <a href="https://energysparks.uk/activity_types/75" target="_blank">this activity</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        2. <strong>Food</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        &#183; We all have to eat, but perhaps we could eat more vegetarian food,
        which has about 60% of the carbon emissions of a meat-based meal
      </p>
      <p>
        3. <strong>Energy</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        &#183; Reducing your school's energy consumption is the simplest solution.
        Use Energy Sparks to determine the best way of saving energy; the
        easiest ways are to make sure heating and hot water are not left on over
        weekends, and holidays, to turn appliances and lighting off, and to make
        sure the school purchases the most efficient equipment when replacing
        appliances. Specific suggestions, using information which Energy Sparks
        has calculated for your school include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> You could reduce the schools gas CO2 emissions by 59&percnt; by turning your heating and hot water off out of school hours,  during weekends and holidays, saving 72,000 kg CO2 per year. </li> <li> For every 1C you turn the thermostat down by you would save 9,000 kg CO2 or 7.4&percnt; of your gas CO2 emissions</li> <li> Every 10 &percnt; reduction in electricity baseload would save 3,800 kg CO2 or 4.3&percnt; of your annual electricity CO2 emissions </li> <li>For every 10 solar PV panels you install you could save 510 kg CO2 or 0.58&percnt; of your annual electricity CO2 emissions</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Put together a plan to achieve each of these. Re-enter the new numbers
        into the spreadsheet and see how much carbon the school will save?
      </p>
      <p>
        To stop catastrophic global warming the UK has committed to reduce its
        carbon emissions to zero by 2050, which is about 4% per year. Can you come
        up with a plan for your school for the next 5 years which would reduce its
        carbon emissions by 20%?
